This insignia is a result of entering [Eragora](Eragora "wikilink") via
the Sphynx Gate. It will eventually wear off, but until it does the
bearer cannot exit Eragora via the Sphynx Gate. Upon entering the room
you will be knocked off your feet by "a massive blast of wind" and moved
to the room "On uneven ground" (the local cloud) in the south of [Rhuien
Forest](Rhuien_Forest "wikilink").
