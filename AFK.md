*Away From Keyboard means just that... you're not at the computer and
cannot respond. When you type 'AFK', a
[flag](:Category:_Character_Flags.md "wikilink") appears in front of
your name on the [WHO](Who.md "wikilink") list, in the
[room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink"), and in your
[prompt](Prompt.md "wikilink"). The next time you type a
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"), however, the [AFK
flag](AFK_Flag.md "wikilink") is removed automatically. If you don't do
anything for several minutes you will automatically be given the [AFK
flag](AFK_Flag.md "wikilink").*

Syntax: afk.
