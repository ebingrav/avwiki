*Away From Keyboard means just that... you're not at the computer and
cannot respond. When you type 'AFK', a
[flag](:Category:_Character_Flags "wikilink") appears in front of your
name on the [WHO](Who "wikilink") list, in the
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"), and in your
[prompt](Prompt "wikilink"). The next time you type a
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"), however, the [AFK
flag](AFK_Flag "wikilink") is removed automatically. If you don't do
anything for several minutes you will automatically be given the [AFK
flag](AFK_Flag "wikilink").*

Syntax: afk.
