    What this bizarre creature is doing around here, is beyond you.
    It looks like a cross between a small wyvern and a pterodactyl,
    with reptilian skin and razor-sharp fangs. From what you know
    of these creatures, they are normal creatures that have been
    magically transformed by the work of a powerful wizard or mage.
    This one's presence leads you to believe there may be one such
    wizard in this area.

## Comments

There are multiple wild darken beasts found in [the flowing
landscape](The_flowing_landscape.md "wikilink"). The one that shows as
**A darkenbeast feeds on a burnt corpse.** in the room is the one that,
when killed, k-spawns the [Denizen Of The
Wasteland](Denizen_Of_The_Wasteland "wikilink"). You can skin the
[Denizen Of The Wasteland](Denizen_Of_The_Wasteland "wikilink") corpse
to obtain the [Sandblasted Emerald](Sandblasted_Emerald "wikilink").

Upon death, you will see the following room echo, signifying the k-spawn
of [Denizen Of The Wasteland](Denizen_Of_The_Wasteland "wikilink"):

    The darkenbeast dies in agony, screaming with its last fetid breath.
    The scream is answered by a returning bellow of a nearby beast,
    most likely attracted by the promise of an easy meal.
