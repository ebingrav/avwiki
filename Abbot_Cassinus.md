*Abbot Cassinus seems worried. Looking very much his age, the signs of
time line his face, more so than usual. Although grateful to the xorn
for their aid in defending [the
Abbey](:Category:_Nocte_Abbey "wikilink") from the behir, he is worried
about what the xorn might expect in return for that defense. They did
seem rather interested in the store-rooms in the basement...*
