1 'ACOLYTE' 'MORTAL ACOLYTE'  
Acolyte is the Immortal candidate level. Acolytes are nominated by
Immortals evaluated, and may be invited to become full Immortals.
Acolytes are in a training phase. Acolyte status is accessible through
invitation only.  
Acolytes are not full immortals, though all immortal laws are applicable
to their behavior. Acolytes are available to answer questions about
basic game play and help with the orientation of new players to Avatar.
Do not approach an acolyte for serious matters if there is another
immortal available.
