# Adventurer's guilds are places where you can hire [companions](companions "wikilink").

There are four adventure's guilds dotted around Midgaardia. The guilds
are located in the cities of [Solace](Solace "wikilink"),
[Midgaard](Midgaard "wikilink"), [Mervue](Mervue "wikilink") and
[Cathracharraig](Cathracharraig "wikilink").

## Solace Adventurer's Guild

The Solace Adventurer Guild is funded locally by contributions from
[Sol](Sol "wikilink") and from the orphanage just within Solace's gates,
after seeing too many young adventurers struggling to find their way.

If you are looking for a companion on your adventure and are entering
from the north gates, travel south until you arrive at Intersection of
Gullen Way. Turn towards East Gullen Way. Head south when you spy the
Adventurer's Guild building. Don't forget to bring some gold, unless you
are an adventurer who prefers the services of the demonbank.

You can rent the companions in this guild from level 11 onwards.

### Companions available in The Solace Adventurer's Guild

-   Norhand, a level 11 cleric
-   Rikar, a level 11 warrior
-   Airen, a level 12 mage

## Midgaard Adventurer's Guild

Are you going on a long journey but you're not sure if you have brought
enough potions or magical items? Or perhaps you need some help killing a
particular mob? Then seek out the Adventurer Guild in
[Midgaard](Midgaard "wikilink") and request the services of some hardy
adventurers to come with you..

The Midgaard Adventurer's Guild lies just off of Solace Lane, west of
Midgaard Keep. Don't forget to bring some gold, unless you are an
adventurer who prefers the services of the demonbank.

You can rent the companions in this guild from level 21 onwards.  
The Adventurer's guild is 4w, s, of Aelmon.

## Mervue Adventurer's Guild

Many trustworthy companions have been hired from the Mervue Adventurer's
Guild. Countless lives have been saved when road-weary persons such as
yourself use their services.

The Mervue Adventurer's Guild lies on the southern edge of
[Mervue](Mervue "wikilink"), overlooking the docks and the Sea of
Strayed Hopes, on one of the fine residential streets.

## Cathracharraig Adventurer's Guild

Only the bravest (or the most foolish) seek the companionship and
services offered by the Adventurer's Guild in
[Cathracharraig](Cathracharraig "wikilink"). While the establishment is
known for its high standards of battle combat, sometimes the buyers
still end up missing, presumed dead.

Rumor has it that the guild can be found in the public house of
[Cathracharraig](Cathracharraig "wikilink"), though the owner of the
guild is at best shadowy in his negotiations and sparse with details.

You can rent the companions in this guild from level 41 onwards.

-   Teli, a level 41 warrior
