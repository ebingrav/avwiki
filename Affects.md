    Syntax: affects
       or   affects ?<keyphrase>

Affects shows what spells or special conditions are currently affecting
you. The same info can be shown at the bottom of
[SCORE](Score.md "wikilink"). Upon reaching level 25, you can also see a
duration value. If you are adept with the spell or skill affecting you,
or if you are adept with '[magic lore](Magic_Lore.md "wikilink")', you
will be able to see the exact duration of that affect. Otherwise, you
see only a vague duration timespan.

The optional parameter allows filtering the results of the affect list,
e.g. affects ?san will show only those affects whose name contains a
word starting with 'san', like sanctuary. A special keyphrase is
'exhaustion', which will show all exhausted spells, including racial
fatigues.
