*Age can be determined by typing [score](Score "wikilink"). Your
[score](Score "wikilink") will list how many hours you've been online
and will also convert that into relative years which determines your
age.*

*Age is used in a few minor bits of code otherwise it has no meaning
right now in Avatar. You cannot die from old age and you do not become
weaker as you reach a ripe old age of 1000.*
