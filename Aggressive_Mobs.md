Aggressive [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") are those
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") that will attack players without
provocation. These can be very dangerous, especially at higher
[levels](Level.md "wikilink") where many of them can [detect
invisible](Detect_Invis.md "wikilink") and/or [detect
hidden](Detect_Hidden.md "wikilink").

Note that there are two different subtypes of aggressive
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"); one subtype will attack any
players it sees, while another subtype will attack only players it sees
who are up to five levels larger than it is.

If an aggressive [mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") is also
[wimpy](Wimpy_Mobs.md "wikilink"), then it will act aggressively only
toward sleeping players.
