*With this skill, an [assassin](:Category:_Assassins "wikilink") can aim
at a target's vital areas, assuming the target has any. Certain vital
areas may do more damage than a normal hit, whereas others might have
secondary affects like blinding. Note that specifying a region to hit is
optional. If none is specified, assume the
[archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") will aim for the vital area at
which he has the clearest shot. This is somewhat easier than choosing to
aim for a specific area. If you are already shooting one target, and
wish to aim at another, you must first change targets with the
[shoot](Shoot "wikilink") [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"). You
must already be in combat to use this
[skill](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): none.
