*With this skill, an [assassin](:Category:_Assassins.md "wikilink") can
aim at a target's vital areas, assuming the target has any. Certain
vital areas may do more damage than a normal hit, whereas others might
have secondary affects like blinding. Note that specifying a region to
hit is optional. If none is specified, assume the
[archer](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink") will aim for the vital area
at which he has the clearest shot. This is somewhat easier than choosing
to aim for a specific area. If you are already shooting one target, and
wish to aim at another, you must first change targets with the
[shoot](Shoot.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"). You must already be in
combat to use this [skill](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): none.
