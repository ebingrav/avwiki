## Comments

The gear the mob wears has an [inventory
flag](Inventory_Flag.md "wikilink"), so it can't be looted. Hence, the
only piece of gear you can get is the aura of elemental power, which
will only load 50% of the time. If you die to the mob, it is possible
that you get more than one of them when you finally kill it.

The mob is a stormlord. It can cast cloudburst and bash. The shield
which the mob carries is charged with flash, so it can potentially blind
you.
