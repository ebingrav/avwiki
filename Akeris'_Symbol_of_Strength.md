## Guide

Embed the following:

-   2 Perfect Diamond
-   1 Perfect Ruby
-   1 Perfect Emerald

Embed these into any level **amulet** armor item with a base (needs to
have keyword 'amulet', for example [Green
Amulet](Green_Amulet "wikilink")). The green amulet from the green
knight's has been proven; likely that there are others that work, too.

Once successful cast manifest:

    c manifest amulet "akeris' Symbol of Strength"

Copy and paste the command, and if you want to enter it manually, be
sure to use double quotes.

## Comments

As always, hero manifest items will have bases from B12 to B14,
regardless of the original sash's base.

See [embed](embed "wikilink") for more tips on how to safely use this
skill.

You wear akeris' Symbol of Strength around your neck. One of the
original members of the \[BEH\] Akeris always fought bravely - and now
so will you.
