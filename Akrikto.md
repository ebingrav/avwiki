*This big build Half-Orc looks even tougher than normal. The fact that
he is a butcher and works with the monstrous Catoblepas would explain
his formidable build. His facial expression is somewhat less impressive.
With eyes pointing towards his nose and the mouth hanging slightly open,
it seems he has some dificulty trying to figure out if he is in fact
awake.*
