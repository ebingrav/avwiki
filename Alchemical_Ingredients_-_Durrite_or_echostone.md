### Durrite or echostone items

-   [staff of fire and
    destruction](Staff_of_Fire_and_Destruction.md "wikilink") (this is a
    staff with 5 charges of burning hands; I got mine from Zahri's
    statue quest. For some reason it has a "durrite" extra desc: "look
    durrite" =\> "You look at a staff of fire and destruction in your
    inventory... Durrite has all sorts of magical properties. It is said
    in certain forms it can act as a minor healing agent...")
-   [shard of echostone](Shard_of_Echostone.md "wikilink")
-   [Shard Of Durrite](Shard_Of_Durrite "wikilink")

## Ineligible items

-   Durrite wrist guard from Derrigh (alchemist acknowledges that it has
    durrite but says a more elemental form is needed)

Note that this ingredient doesn't need to be alchemical (not limited to
skin or kspawn).
