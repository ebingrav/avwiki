''In the company of traveling wizards, an alchemist plies their trade:
performing transmutations for those who seek their wisdom.

''The process of distilling essences from natural reagents is laborious
and exacting, but offers a glimpse into the very fabric of the world, as
fundamental elements react in exciting new ways. This is probably much
more interesting to the alchemist than it is to their client; but worry
not, because you get something out of it too! The combination of both
alchemy and artifice allows for the transmutation of mundane items into
new and wondrous creations.

''======== Now, the important part ------------------------------------

''The components that the alchemist will ask of their clients are called
NATURAL REAGENTS, which are parts of mobs that have been skinned or
spawned from a fresh kill, or items that have been made from such parts;
though sometimes a reaction will call for other ingredients, such as
rare or magical metals. Two copies of a reagent can never be combined in
a reaction. And for opaque ideological reasons, the alchemist will never
perform a transmutation that consumes containers.

''The alchemist's clients will have ample opportunity to STOP or CANCEL
any transmutation before it begins, which is why there are no refunds on
items spent on the alchemist's work!
