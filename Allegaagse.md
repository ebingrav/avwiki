## Allegaagse

*Tired of his brethren's squabbles for gold, power and magical
artifacts,  
*Allegaagse has devoted his life to amassing mundane items in his
hoard.  
*He is quite proud that even though his collection is ugly and useless
it  
*is still unique and outshines that of any of his rivals throughout
all  
''of the realms.

## Room

*The Hoard  
*Massive mounds of the most useless items found throughout the planes  
*are piled wall to wall in this gigantic chamber. Many of the objects  
*are things Woe wouldn't bother carrying in his shop.  
*The dragon that resides here is always looking to increase the size  
*of his piles and set himself up to be near the lord community to  
*use them for collecting. He has even posted a plaque with some  
*details about the tasks he has in mind.

## Insignia Levels

Allegaagse grants you an insignia for returning desired items to him.
The very first insignia he will grant you is <b>Scratcher</b>. When you
see the message:

    Allegaagse says 'You have done such a good job that I have raised my estimation of your worth as a searcher.'

you know that you have been granted "bonus points" towards the next
insignia level.

1.  Scratcher
2.  Busybody
3.  Deed Doer
4.  Goto Guy/Gal/Person
5.  Feat Finisher
6.  Task Master

Each level takes progressively more turn-ins to achieve, eg, the amount
of turn-ins to get from Feat Finisher to Task Master (one step) is about
the same as it takes to go from Deed Doer to Feat Finisher (2 steps).

The best rewards can be achieved when you reach Feat Finisher / Task
Master, including 15,000 xp bonus, 25 qp and shard gear.

## Comments

To start this daily quest, find [Allegaagse](Allegaagse "wikilink") west
of [Meta](Meta "wikilink") in the [Lord Mud
School](Lord_Mud_School "wikilink") and give him a
[ruby](ruby "wikilink"). He'll give you a hint (listed above) of which
item he is looking for and you can go hunt for it. This quest can be
completed no more than once per day (starting and ending at 00:00 system
time) per alt. If you do not have or can't get the item in question, you
can give up by saying "I give up" in the room with the mob. Giving up
adds an additional day to the delay before you can play again (however
it doesn't negatively affect your progress towards the next rank).

For assistance on how to find these items, please see: [Meep's Guide to
Alleg](Alleg_Guide_MEEP "wikilink")

    progress). Don't bother using on a Task Master alt.

    other item.
