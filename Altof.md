Syntax: 910+ Imm command

ALTOF is used to set, and determine, the designated alternate of your
character which may use gear that you have insured. Your alt then may
use and save gear that you yourself have insured, EXCEPT for quest items
which have their own rules for transfer (See HELP QUEST ITEM TRANSFER).
Level restrictions on gear use also remain.

The designated alt MUST be your own character.

Each character may only be set as ONE Altof another character.

For Example: The best way to share insured gear is to insure all gear on
one alt, and set that alt as the altof your other characters. This would
make the insured alt's gear useable by your other characters.

Please contact an available Host Senior or higher to obtain this
service.
