Syntax: amplify on, amplify off  
Prerequisite: [Arcane Knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge "wikilink")

At an advanced level, [mages](:Category:Mages.md "wikilink") and
[wizards](:Category:Wizards.md "wikilink") can gain a greater
understanding into the elemental nature of reality. This insight allows
some spells to grow in power alongside their caster.

Once you learn this ability, you must type AMPLIFY ON to begin using it.
Your affected spells will remained amplified until you type AMPLIFY OFF.

Against ordinary foes, an amplified spell will do nearly (but not quite)
as much damage as your most potent offensive spell. However, if you
encounter an enemy that is susceptible to a particular type of damage,
one of these previously disregarded spells may prove to be your most
powerful weapon. The mana cost of an amplified spell increases similarly
to its damage.

The following spells are affected by amplification:  
fireball, lightning bolt, acid blast, icestrike, magma blast, chain
lightning, cyclone, firestorm

disintegrate, acid rain (Lord+ only)  
maelstrom, meteor swarm (Legend+ only)
