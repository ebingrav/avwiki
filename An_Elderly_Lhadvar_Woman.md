*The mother of the tribal ClanChief sits quietly here.*

*Wife to Sh'Sl'Rath, mother to S'larn and ever the village wise woman,
M'La'Rhesh is growing old and tired. She has no daughter to learn her
skills and her son has not yet taken a wife. So she still works every
day to help maintain the health of her people. She attends every birth,
and from her ever decreasing store of herbs and things, she continues to
make potions and pills to aid the healing spells of the tribal Shaman.
She has little magic herself, what she once had has faded with age. Her
hands are still supple but unlike most of the Lhadvar, they are webbed
like her feet. This has never slowed her down. The scales around her
eyes have not faded from the warm amber she had in her youth, but her
piercing, a beautiful silver ring studded with amber, a gift from her
father when she came of age, no longer fits as snug as it used to. She
loves her husband and son and is proud of the work they have done to
keep the tribe safe and secure.*
