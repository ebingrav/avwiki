*Captured long ago in the Willow Palace by Jacros, this
[elf](Elves "wikilink") has gone mad from loneliness. He remembers very
little of his former life, forgetting even his own name. All he knows is
that once he loved [someone](Elsera "wikilink") so completely that not
even madness can drive her from his mind. Tired and sickly, he no longer
wishes to go on living. His one desire is that even in death he can
express his feelings to [his beloved](Elsera "wikilink"), if she still
lives among [the Willow
Elves](:Category:_Kingdom_Of_The_Willows "wikilink").*
