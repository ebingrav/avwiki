Mob that you can skin for its scalp (gith remort quest) and
occassionally carries QPs.

## Directions

Go to Astral and start the Memory Lane run (Shift astral, start
following this path: 2nusd2wneuse2dnw2sd3endwn2u). Follow the directions
until you kill a pain elemental that opens a portal (sphere on ground).

nter the sphere and proceed through a short maze until you get to the
leech area.

Use the 'Exit' command to progress through the rooms, to The Fate of the
Elementals. The rooms to move to are in this order:

`The elemental Army -> rise of the dark fae -> rise of the dark fae -> the final victory -> the tide turns -> the fate of the elementals -> the fate of the elementals `

Enter the nexus and go down. You can now track the mindflayer. You may
also want to kill all the leeches in one pop and set the anchor in the
lloydable room if anyone needs to run the level 500 PaE/Fdk evolve quest
(also a Pal quest)
