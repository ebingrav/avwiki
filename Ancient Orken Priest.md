*He takes a deep breath and smiles before beginning. "Many centuries
ago, [this city](:Category:_Orkenhome "wikilink") was called Whitehome,
named after the white limestone of [this
city](:Category:_Orkenhome "wikilink"), and it was a city of proud, but
enslaved [deep gnomes](Deep_Gnomes "wikilink"). They were under the
direct control of the [High Drow](Drow "wikilink") who forced them to
mine the white rock for them to build with. It was a horrible
undignified existence." "Things might have gone on that way forever, but
a single [orc](Orcs "wikilink") changed everything. [The
city](:Category:_Orkenhome "wikilink") was much smaller in those days.
It could barely have been called a village. [Orken](Orcs "wikilink")
slaves would come from [the city of the High
Drow](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria "wikilink") every week and deliver
huge loads of the white brick." "One day, word reached the village that
the [orcs](Orcs "wikilink") had rebelled against their
[drow](Drow "wikilink") masters on the way to pick up a shipment of
bricks. Most of the [orcs](Orcs "wikilink") were killed, but the
[orc](Orcs "wikilink") who had led the uprising, called Uglash, escaped.
The [High Drow](Drow "wikilink") warned the [gnomes](Gnomes "wikilink")
that if they should see him, he was to be killed on sight." "Well, as
luck would have it, Uglash wandered into [the
city](:Category:_Orkenhome "wikilink") a week later, starving and near
death. The [gnomes](Gnomes "wikilink") all debated on whether or not to
obey, but they were not killers. They hid the [orc](Orcs "wikilink"),
nursed him back to health, then helped him escape. But the [High
Drow](Drow "wikilink") eventually found out. They could've slaughtered
the [gnomes](Gnomes "wikilink") for their insurrection, but they decided
upon an even more cruel punishment." "Using dark magic, they cursed the
[gnomes](Gnomes "wikilink") of Whitehome and their descendants to live
forever in the bodies of [orcs](Orcs "wikilink")." "Not long after, the
fall of the [High Drow](Drow "wikilink") began, and the citizens sealed
off [the city](:Category:_Orkenhome "wikilink") to survive. Centuries
later, this place is called
[Orkenhome](:Category:_Orkenhome "wikilink"), and the people consider a
blessing what was once their curse."*
