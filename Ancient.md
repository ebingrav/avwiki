''How does one see a soul? Is it energy, and if so, can it not take any
shape or form it wishes to be viewed as? The spirit undulates between
various abstract shapes, emanating amusement at its play.

*An Ancient tells you 'But what of destiny? What of fate and truth? Do
these have no role in the great evolution of the universe, do they even
exist? Well, of course. We have been here since the dawn of the dawns of
time. We exist here to observe the advancement of the world and the
universe, and have existed outside of the cycle of time. Through every
cycle, as much as some things change, some remain the same. New souls in
old patterns, until the universe collectively gets it right.*'
