*Captured long ago in the Willow Palace by Jacros, this
[elf](Elves.md "wikilink") has gone mad from loneliness. He remembers
very little of his former life, forgetting even his own name. All he
knows is that once he loved [someone](Elsera.md "wikilink") so
completely that not even madness can drive her from his mind. Tired and
sickly, he no longer wishes to go on living. His one desire is that even
in death he can express his feelings to [his
beloved](Elsera.md "wikilink"), if she still lives among [the Willow
Elves](:Category:_Kingdom_Of_The_Willows.md "wikilink").*
