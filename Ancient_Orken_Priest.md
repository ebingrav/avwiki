*He takes a deep breath and smiles before beginning. "Many centuries
ago, [this city](:Category:_Orkenhome.md "wikilink") was called
Whitehome, named after the white limestone of [this
city](:Category:_Orkenhome.md "wikilink"), and it was a city of proud,
but enslaved [deep gnomes](Deep_Gnomes.md "wikilink"). They were under
the direct control of the [High Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") who forced
them to mine the white rock for them to build with. It was a horrible
undignified existence." "Things might have gone on that way forever, but
a single [orc](Orcs.md "wikilink") changed everything. [The
city](:Category:_Orkenhome.md "wikilink") was much smaller in those
days. It could barely have been called a village.
[Orken](Orcs.md "wikilink") slaves would come from [the city of the High
Drow](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria.md "wikilink") every week and deliver
huge loads of the white brick." "One day, word reached the village that
the [orcs](Orcs.md "wikilink") had rebelled against their
[drow](Drow.md "wikilink") masters on the way to pick up a shipment of
bricks. Most of the [orcs](Orcs.md "wikilink") were killed, but the
[orc](Orcs.md "wikilink") who had led the uprising, called Uglash,
escaped. The [High Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") warned the
[gnomes](Gnomes.md "wikilink") that if they should see him, he was to be
killed on sight." "Well, as luck would have it, Uglash wandered into
[the city](:Category:_Orkenhome.md "wikilink") a week later, starving
and near death. The [gnomes](Gnomes.md "wikilink") all debated on
whether or not to obey, but they were not killers. They hid the
[orc](Orcs.md "wikilink"), nursed him back to health, then helped him
escape. But the [High Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") eventually found out.
They could've slaughtered the [gnomes](Gnomes.md "wikilink") for their
insurrection, but they decided upon an even more cruel punishment."
"Using dark magic, they cursed the [gnomes](Gnomes.md "wikilink") of
Whitehome and their descendants to live forever in the bodies of
[orcs](Orcs.md "wikilink")." "Not long after, the fall of the [High
Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") began, and the citizens sealed off [the
city](:Category:_Orkenhome.md "wikilink") to survive. Centuries later,
this place is called [Orkenhome](:Category:_Orkenhome.md "wikilink"),
and the people consider a blessing what was once their curse."*
