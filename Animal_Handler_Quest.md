This quest confers the [Eragora - Animal
Handler](Eragora_-_Animal_Handler "wikilink") to the entire group
completing it, and is located within
[Rapture](:Category:Rapture.md "wikilink") on
[Eragora](:Category:Eragora.md "wikilink").

Simply find a proper docile mob and decide to open a butcher shop. If
you survive, you get the insignia and its bonus. Be aware at least one
of the mobs stomps (company of catoblepa)

This quest begins with killing one goat and ends with killing "the
united army of the remaining fauna" ("(White Aura) Everything has just
arrived. Everything.") At least one of the mobs in the room eats
corpses. It was straightforward to complete with 5 small fusiliers
hitting and a 999 mage tanking, with one hitter's death along the way.

If you try to complete this quest with shadowed lords, you'll spawn a
level 145 mob called a "terrifying sussurus", with message " The death
echoes through the marshes, and you hear a slithering sound. Apparently,
vegetation approaches." Not sure what happens next (my group died).

Quest grants a 200 hp bonus. If you complete this quest again within its
2 week expiry period, it updates the expiry date to 2 weeks from when it
was completed again.
