<wielded>`           `[`three`` ``juggling`` ``fireballs`](Three_Juggling_Fireballs "wikilink")

## Comments

Faustus wanders, and is too high a level for heroes to see with detect
invis, so you'll have to area-spell or let it attack you.  
Faustus will sometimes throw the fireballs, and they will blow up, so
try to kill it quickly or stun it if you're looking for them.
