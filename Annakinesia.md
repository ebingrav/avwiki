*Annakinesia was born as the [drow](Drow.md "wikilink") mortal, LLoth.
She always aspired to join the
[Pantheon](:Category:Gods_And_Goddesses.md "wikilink") and was ruthless
in her ambitions. An initial scheme on her part failed and she was
struck down and lay in torpor for many years while her followers were
cursed into the form of driders by the will of the established Gods.
They maintained their faith and eventually along with the unwitting help
from [The Bond's](:Category:The_Bond.md "wikilink") cultists (and some
Lords of the Realm) she was finally able to ascend. She now walks the
Pantheon as the Allmother to [Driders](Driders "wikilink") and Goddess
of Spiders. Those who work from the shadows might find their calling
with the Allweaver.*
