We are planning events throughout the month of August to celebrate the
19th anniversary of AVATAR MUD! [HoGs](hog "wikilink"), mini-quests, Imm
quest events (e.g Push Your Luck), some surprise events, quizzes and
more besides!

The list below contains events for which we have a fixed date. There are
more events than this, but due to work and other real-world
complications, they will either be announced nearer the time, or sprung
upon you by surprise. :D

### Big Quests

-   16th of August - **The Sundered Race**

<!-- -->

    Few remember the fearsome power of the mindflayer empire
    before it fell to the slave revolt led by the Giths
    but some things which have been forgotten are not
    truly gone.

    Lord Quest + new temp area. 16 August 2014.
    Death, fun, loot.

### Racial boons every Saturday

After polling was conducted on outland.org, it looks like Saturday has
won for the 'boon day'. All races receive an xp boost, plus 3 other
boons (for instance spell damage, bonus to archery, chance to hit more
often, etc). Gains are NOT affected. Races will be divided as follows
(see HELP SIZE):

-   August 9th is small races.
-   August 16th is medium races.
-   August 23rd is large races.
-   August 30th is very large races + all fdk + all imp.

The boon begins shortly after 12:00:01 AM and lasts until 11:59:59 PM
EST. If you are interested to see what each race gets, check the
outland.org anniversary news item (click 'Read More').
