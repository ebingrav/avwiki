## Comments

Queen Ant description for ant antenna

The queen looks quite agitated that her work has been  
interrupted. Roused from her slumber by the volcano, she  
has been hard at work to add her own spire to the jungle.  
Though her wings appear to be undeveloped, her size is  
quite formidable.

Good for casters. Don't forget to have it [runed](Rune.md "wikilink")
for ac.
