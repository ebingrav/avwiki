## Comments

Queen Ant description for chakram

The queen looks quite agitated that her work has been  
interrupted. Roused from her slumber by the volcano, she  
has been hard at work to add her own spire to the jungle.  
Sprouting from her thorax, her huge wings slice through  
the air. Each wing is composed of overlapping circular  
sections which give them support and the strength to cut  
through opponents with their edges.

Good for psis. Can be sharpened. This is skinned from the queen ant in
Savage Jungle, the same mob that also yields [Ant
Antenna](Ant_Antenna "wikilink"). However the antenna queen is far more
common that chakram queen (one recent camp yielded 3 chakrams in about
20 pops).
