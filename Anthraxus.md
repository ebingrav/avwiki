*This is the demon master and lord of the lower planes; his name,
Anthraxus the Decayed. He appears as a tall man in a rotted grey suit
and cape. His head is that of a ram deformed by disease. His mouth foams
and the wool pulls away from the skin by the handful. There are boils
and blisters over his exposed skin and his flesh is pulled taut over his
bones.*
