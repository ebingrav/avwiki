## Comments

Mob first occurs 3n, 1e, 1u from the area's entrance (and safe room),
but is found in other rooms with an up exit. Occasionally one can
encounter one harpy in the room, but generally they're found in 3s.
Their sniping is excruciatingly painful and can often kill even higher
level heroes who've just finished another mob in an adjacent room, and
are thus worse for wear hp-wise. Lowheroes are 1-hit kills, generally.
Their melee is considerably less painful than their shooting, but they
are still dangerous to fight (invis wraiths may wander in, etc.).
