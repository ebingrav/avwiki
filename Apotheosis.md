*It is fairly well known that Lloth was a spider-goddess worshipped by
many of the drow and High Drow. Her influence can still be seen today.
What is not commonly known is that Lloth was no goddess, but rather a
spider-demon of the underworld. When she was defeated, the vast majority
of her followers and priests were transformed into Driders, hideous
mixtures of drow and spider. Most of these driders remember little of
their heritage, and are little better than beasts.*

*Some however remembered their history and worked in the shadows to
engineer the return of their Mother. Thanks to enduring patience, divine
arts and cunning deception, She has now returned - no longer the False
Goddess Lloth but the divine Annakinesia. Her loyal followers have been
rewarded with this realm and they do not tolerate any who are unworthy.*
