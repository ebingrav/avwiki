*You see a faint wispy figure of an old man. For some strange reason you
can see through him, to the scenery beyond! His face is haggard and
drawn with pain and discomfort. His strange glowing eyes fasten onto
you.*

`     Nothing.`

`An apparition is carrying:`  
`     `[`A`` ``bottle`` ``of`` ``spring`` ``water`](Bottle_Of_Spring_Water.md "wikilink")

## Comments

There are two apparitions in the area, and only one carries the bottle.
One must also kill both apparitions for the bottle to repop.

## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"):**
[Nubrius](:Category:_Nubrius.md "wikilink")
([Map](Nubrius_Map.md "wikilink")).  
An apparition [wanders](Wandering_Mobs.md "wikilink"), and is portable.
However, there are apparitions in other areas as well, so portaling is
unreliable.
