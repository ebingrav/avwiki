*You see a faint wispy figure of an old man. For some strange reason you
can see through him, to the scenery beyond! His face is haggard and
drawn with pain and discomfort. His strange glowing eyes fasten onto
you.*

## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"):**
[Nubrius](:Category:_Nubrius "wikilink")
([Map](Nubrius_Map "wikilink")).  
An apparition [wanders](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink"), and is portable.
However, there are apparitions in other areas as well, so portaling is
unreliable.
