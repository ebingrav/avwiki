*Like [banks](:Category:_Banks.md "wikilink"), you need to be in a
certain place to use this [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink").
Appraising an [object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") while in the
same [room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") as a
[Smith](:Category:_Smiths.md "wikilink") will give you a price on how
much the [Smith](:Category:_Smiths.md "wikilink") will
[repair](Repair.md "wikilink") your
[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") for you. Remember! A
[Smith](:Category:_Smiths.md "wikilink") will
[repair](Repair.md "wikilink") your
[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") perfectly, which is better
than your own. This is also a good
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") to use for testing for the
existence of a [Smith](:Category:_Smiths.md "wikilink") in your
[room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink").*

Syntax: appraise \<[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")\>.
