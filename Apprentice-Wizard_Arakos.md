*This small creature is wearing odd, cut-off trousers that glow with
some kind of power. Around him is a bubble of air, another enchantment.
He looks scared and angry, clutching his staff close.*

## Comments

Arakos is tough. Really tough. Although a mnd, he opens with a flash.
Reaching him solo may require calming, so count on your spells being
reduced in power, and your mana partially gone.

The key he is carrying is the key to [Captain
Drago](Captain_Drago "wikilink")'s room (keywords: 'key cabinkey cabin
iron').

## Directions

He's in the sunken ship - 2d, w, \[d\], n, \[e\] from
[Mayflower](Mayflower "wikilink")'s drop-room (follow Mayflower to get
to drop room).
