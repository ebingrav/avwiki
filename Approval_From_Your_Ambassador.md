## A Tradeable Quest Item

This item is received each time you complete a Diplomatic Corps quest.

After reaching Hero, certain shopkeeper mobs will speak to the player
upon entering the room (not all the time, one may have to reenter the
room a few times to trigger their speech). They usually ask "Anything to
trade?", indicating they will exchange the approval for a quest potion.
The potion will be bound, so only the character which did the DC quest
can drink it. Also take special care when swapping gear between alts and
quitting, as the bound potions cannot be saved by another character and
will fall to the floor.

These potions are especially important to those players wishing to
defeat the [Ultimate Dragon](:Category:Hero_Quest.md "wikilink"), since
these may be the only sources of certain spells, in potion form.

Shopkeepers have one or two potions in stock, and will trade a random
one for the approval - receiving the desired potion is a matter of luck.

All potions hold a lvl 60 spell.
