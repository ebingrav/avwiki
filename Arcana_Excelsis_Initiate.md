This quest in [Arcana Excelsis](:Category:Arcana_Excelsis "wikilink")
leads to the insignia Arcana Excelsis Initiate, which modifies mana
regeneration by + 3% continuous until hero level 250 (the mana regen
bonus goes away at 250, but the insignia itself is still there - see
note below).

You need to be at least level 35 and able to see invisible objects to
find the entrance to Arcana Excelsis. To see an essential mob you need
to be at least level 39. This quest is completable before hero level 200
(possibly higher, though 447 is too high).

Start by bowing to Itania.

Note that you will not be able to start the quest if you have the Arcana
Excelsis Initiate insignia from a previous incarnation (it does not
disappear on remort).
