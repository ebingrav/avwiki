(NOTE: The 2 lower rooms once you go down are NO REGEN and have mobs
that are not aggy in them to invis/move hidden, and they don't move so
you can flee if you don't want to fight them. 2 in the first room and 2
in the room with the "Failed Experiment" that you don't have to kill but
will assist when you attack the "Failed Experiment" you can either kill
them, quicken calm/awe and move, or flee)

Experiment" mob, then repeat step 3)  
c tel vymm;s;u;o e;e;e;un e;o e;e;un d;o d;d;e

  

(btw the since I use zMUD the ; you see is the way the program
serperates commands)

I hope this helps people looking for that nice hp wield item, just
remember not to use it for fighting or leveling due to -wis and -hit/dam
mods on the staff.
