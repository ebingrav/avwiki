*Her piercing eyes and smooth dark skin make her beautiful, despite her
stumpy dwarven body. She rules the Dark followers of Kra by example and
by will. None dare challenge her authority for only her faithful

Arcanthra also possesses a keen mind that lately has been plotting a
secret alliance with [Crullius the
White](Crullius_The_White "wikilink").*
