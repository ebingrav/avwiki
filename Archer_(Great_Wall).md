## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"):** [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink")
([Map](Highways/Great_Wall_Map "wikilink")).  
An archer [wanders](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink"), but is found on the
Great Wall. Head up from the [Captain Of The Guard
(Tower)](Captain_Of_The_Guard_(Tower) "wikilink"), and then south. Then
continue along the wall until you find the archer. Not all archers are
carrying a crossbow, be sure to look at them.

An archer is portable.
