Syntax: areas <lowest level> <highest level>

AREAS shows you all the areas in the game, with the author's name and
the suggested levels. If you simply type 'area', you'll get the entire
list.

You can, however, pick a level range you desire to see. So if you were
to type 'area 5 10', only the areas that are suggested for levels 5
through 10 will appear.

NOTE: This means that if the area levels of an area is 1-51, and you
pick an area range of 1-2, the area WILL show up on the reduced list.

*That means that just because an area appears on your reduced list, it
does not mean it is safe for you.*
