*So. You've broken the law, you've been declared an
[OUTLAW](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink"), and a [city
guard](Townguard_Mobs "wikilink") has arrested you. What's next?*

''There is no judge, no jury, and no appeals process; such are the faded
relics of imperfect legal systems and are totally unnecessary in [Lawful
cities](:Category:_Lawful_Areas "wikilink"). There is, however, a
[jail](Jail_Rooms "wikilink"); once arrested,
[outlaws](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink") are dragged there and left to rot
until the [jailer](Jailer_Mobs "wikilink") feels like dealing with you.
This usually doesn't take very long; the
[jailer](Jailer_Mobs "wikilink") of a [Lawful
city](:Category:_Lawful_Areas "wikilink") loves his job. His job is to
review your case and decide what punishment is necessary. You might be
sent home to think about your crimes; you might be assessed a fine; or
you might be sent to [Death Row](Death_Row_Rooms "wikilink") to enter
the [executioner](Executioner_Mobs "wikilink")'s queue. The outcome is
predicated on your history of prior arrests, the severity of your crime,
your financial status, and whether the [jailer](Jailer_Mobs "wikilink")
had breakfast that morning. (Hey, at least he admits his decisions are
arbitrary. You're a criminal; you'll take what you get!)

*A tally of the number of times your
[incarnation](Incarnations "wikilink") has been arrested is listed in
the [SCORE](Score "wikilink") command, in the field "Arrests".*

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may view their arrest
tally using their [score](Score "wikilink")
