**Syntax: cast 'artificer blessing**'

*The dwarves of Mt Durr have long been known for their love of metals
and precious gems. They have devised a powerful spell to help their
craftsmen make the most of their time. It can also be used to help
protect their work from damage while being used.*

*An artificer blessing will speed up all crafting related work including
fletching, repairing, restringing and sharpening. It also provides a
limited amount of protection to gear damage and detonation. It will also
provide a (very small) chance of finding perfect gems.*

*This is a powerful pantheon spell. Any single cleric can only maintain
(i.e. be the caster of) one of these spells at any given time.*
