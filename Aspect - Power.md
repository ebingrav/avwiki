*Through the forces of Power, action defines existence. The might at
their command can shape worlds, or crush them. Their influence is felt
in every change, every force of will exerted by every being to walk the
planes. Monarchs of ancient realms speak of the weapon to rule over all,
the [spear of raw energy](the_Skewer_of_Sublime_Supremecy "wikilink")
that would make the very Gods kneel before anyone who carried it.*
