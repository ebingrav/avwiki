*The cycle of death and rebirth is embodied by the forces of evolution.
A balance is seen in all things so long as the cycle is maintained.
Existence depends on the equality of opposition and the fluctuation of
constants. Prophets of change speak of the correspondence of all things,
the object which is at once everything and nothing. In [constant
flux](the_Terminus_of_Tranquility.md "wikilink"), it holds the power to
move the immobile and shake the unshakable.*
