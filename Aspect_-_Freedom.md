*The forces of freedom are at times ephemeral, appearing to exert no
influence on the world around them. Preferring instead to react to all
situations as they come, few of the mortal realm even know of their
existence. Of the truly learned, many have been driven mad seeking the
source of their power, only to have it drift just beyond their grasp--[a
mote of light](the_Will_o'_the_Wisp "wikilink") that they can see, but
never possess.*
