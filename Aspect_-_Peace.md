*The forces of Peace are frequently calm and serene. Above all else,
they respect the wisdom and tranquility in grand designs. Healers and
scholars revere the path that transcends battles, seeing all moments as
one. The sages of Peace still speak of an [orb of
wisdom](the_Righteous_Orb_of_the_Sage.md "wikilink") that dwells beyond
time, though its power remains hidden from their mortal eyes.*
