*Hidden masters of all things, the forces of prophecy occlude the
watchful eyes of all that oppose them. Even the greatest of seers cannot
so much as glimpse their true intentions, and it only feeds their power.
Whispers from nowhere tell of the true center of all influence--[the eye
amid the storm](the_Eye_of_the_Storm "wikilink") of all existence, whose
force cannot be resisted.*
