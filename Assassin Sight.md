''Opportunism at its most deadly, a
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") trained in Assassin's Sight is
adept at sensing and exploiting chances to inflict [vital
shots](Vital_Shot "wikilink"). This manifests in three ways. First and
foremost, the [rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") can exploit the
brief opening created when a foe attempts to [flee](Flee "wikilink")
from them. This "parting shot" requires that the
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") and the
[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") were fighting each other when it tried
to [flee](Flee "wikilink"), and also that the
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") not be in 'lag' from using [a
skill or spell](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink"). Secondly, the
knowledge gained via Assassin's Sight is indispensable in learning more
advanced skills, like [backstab](Backstab "wikilink"). Finally, the
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") gains the ability to sense a foe's
weakest point when making a [vital strike](Vital_Shot "wikilink"). If he
doesn't try to aim for a particular region, the rogue can hit this
'weakest point' and thus inflict more pain and suffering with the [vital
shot](Vital_Shot "wikilink")
[skill](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink"). The increase in damage
is partly based on the [rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink")'s
[intelligence](Intelligence "wikilink").

Prerequisite(s): [Lethal Aim](Lethal_Aim "wikilink"), [Rogue
Lore](Rogue_Lore "wikilink").
