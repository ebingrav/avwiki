''Opportunism at its most deadly, a
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") trained in Assassin's Sight is
adept at sensing and exploiting chances to inflict [vital
shots](Vital_Shot.md "wikilink"). This manifests in three ways. First
and foremost, the [rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") can exploit
the brief opening created when a foe attempts to
[flee](Flee.md "wikilink") from them. This "parting shot" requires that
the [rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") and the
[mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") were fighting each other when it
tried to [flee](Flee.md "wikilink"), and also that the
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") not be in 'lag' from using [a
skill or spell](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink"). Secondly,
the knowledge gained via Assassin's Sight is indispensable in learning
more advanced skills, like [backstab](Backstab.md "wikilink"). Finally,
the [rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") gains the ability to sense
a foe's weakest point when making a [vital
strike](Vital_Shot.md "wikilink"). If he doesn't try to aim for a
particular region, the rogue can hit this 'weakest point' and thus
inflict more pain and suffering with the [vital
shot](Vital_Shot.md "wikilink")
[skill](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink"). The increase in
damage is partly based on the [rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink")'s
[intelligence](Intelligence.md "wikilink").

Prerequisite(s): [Lethal Aim](Lethal_Aim.md "wikilink"), [Rogue
Lore](Rogue_Lore.md "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
