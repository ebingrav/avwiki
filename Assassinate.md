Syntax: assassinate <victim>  
Prerequisite: [assassin
sight](http://avatar.melanarchy.info/index.php?title=Assassin_Sight),
[backstab](http://avatar.melanarchy.info/index.php?title=Backstab)

At Lord level, a rogue's prowess as an assassin is so advanced, that
virtually anything on the
[Midgaardian](:Category:_Midgaardia "wikilink") plane will fall before
their lethal backstab. However, a Lord's calling is elsewhere, and the
Githyanki and Fae and Planar
[Kzin](:Category:_Kzinti_Homeworld "wikilink") and Demons of
[Tarterus](:Category:_Tarterus "wikilink") are a different kind of
enemy, in some cases with entirely different anatomy. A normal backstab
will be almost useless against them.

This skill changes all that.

Assassinate is affected by your race's innate stealthiness. Large or
clumsy races may be spotted moving in for the kill.
