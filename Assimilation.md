*Syntax: cast assimilation <spell name>*

*Paladins are a powerful source of inspiration to any that ally
themselves with these holy warriors. This holy spell provides the
Paladin with a direct manner of benefiting from the diverse nature of
his allies.*

*By casting this spell a Paladin is able to assimilate the knowledge of
a direct, single target attack spell from one of his group members. The
Paladin will then be able to use that spell to good effect so long as he
remains allied and in the presence of someone with the knowledge he has
assimilated. Trying to use an assimilated spell when these conditions
are no longer met will soon lead to a backlash of the spell and prevent
any further usage. Psionic powers cannot be learned with this spell.*

*An Oath of Evolution is required to cast this spell.*
