Some [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"), while not inherently
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), may still join fights taking
place around them, attacking either a fighting player or a fighting
[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"). This behavior is commonly called
"assisting".

Any [mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") will join a fight whenever two
conditions are satisfied, namely (1) either it or a fighting player that
it sees (or both) have [alignment](Alignment "wikilink") below 350, and
(2) its [level](Level "wikilink") and this player's
[level](Level "wikilink") are less than five apart.

[Guard mobs](Guard_Mobs "wikilink") will join any fight in which one or
more combatants (whether [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") or players)
have [alignment](Alignment "wikilink") below 300, attacking whichever
combatant is [aligned](Alignment "wikilink") lowest.

Even some inherently [aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") may be said to "assist" in battle in
some cases, namely whenever players remain
[hidden](Hide_Flag "wikilink") or [invisible](Invis_Flag "wikilink") (or
both) to such [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") until they begin
fighting.
