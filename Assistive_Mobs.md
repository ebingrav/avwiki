Some [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"), while not inherently
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink"), may still join fights
taking place around them, attacking either a fighting player or a
fighting [mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"). This behavior is commonly
called "assisting".

Any [mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") will join a fight whenever two
conditions are satisfied, namely (1) either it or a fighting player that
it sees (or both) have [alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink") below 350,
and (2) its [level](Level.md "wikilink") and this player's
[level](Level.md "wikilink") are less than five apart.

[Guard mobs](Guard_Mobs.md "wikilink") will join any fight in which one
or more combatants (whether [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") or
players) have [alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink") below 300, attacking
whichever combatant is [aligned](Alignment.md "wikilink") lowest.

Even some inherently [aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") may be said to "assist" in battle
in some cases, namely whenever players remain
[hidden](Hide_Flag.md "wikilink") or
[invisible](Invis_Flag.md "wikilink") (or both) to such
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") until they begin fighting.
