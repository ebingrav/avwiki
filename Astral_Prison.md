*With power comes responsibility... or so they say. All you know is that
you can create an astral prison made out of some kind of crystal. The
best part about this thing is that it shrinks, kills your victim, and
traps the soul!!! HAHAHAHA! It gets better!!! Not only does it trap the
soul, kill the victim, and make you laugh... you can suck magical energy
off the soul and it decreases the cost of casting spells! HA!*

*The crystal with the trapped soul is conveniently floating nearby but
it is indeed fragile. It won't last long, so make good use of it!*

Syntax: cast 'astral prison'

Prerequisites: [Immolation](Immolation.md "wikilink")

Presumably this works the same as
[Immolation](Immolation.md "wikilink"): max level for a mob you can
immolate is 1/2 casters level rounded up, so 63 for lords as all lords
are considered level 125. The higher the level of mob immolated, the
longer the affect will last on the caster. If failed the mob will attack
the caster. Despite this, if the immolation succeeds spell affects such
as invisible, which would normally be removed by an attack, remain
intact.
