Syntax: autogroup (toggle)

With autogroup toggled to on, anyone who follows you will be
automatically [grouped](Group "wikilink").

See [CONFIGURE](Config "wikilink") to find out which toggle is on and
which is off.

Please note that when a player is AFK, the autogroup function is
rendered inactive.
