Syntax: autotitle (toggle)  
Syntax: config +/-autotitle  
Autotitle is a toggle. When you type it and it sets to ON then you will
receive a game-generated [title](Title.md "wikilink") each time you
level. But if you type it again, setting autotitle to OFF, your title
will persist until you change it even if you level.
