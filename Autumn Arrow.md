[fletch](Fletch "wikilink") [autumn arrows](Autumn_Arrows "wikilink").*

The Autumn arrow explodes in a rain of leaves just before impact,
potentially blinding enemies. The magic of these arrows is much harder
for enemies to resist than a typical [blind](Blind "wikilink") spell,
but doesn't work if fired over long distances.

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [fletch](Fletch "wikilink")
