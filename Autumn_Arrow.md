arrows](Autumn_Arrows.md "wikilink").*

The Autumn arrow explodes in a rain of leaves just before impact,
potentially blinding enemies. The magic of these arrows is much harder
for enemies to resist than a typical [blind](Blind.md "wikilink") spell,
but doesn't work if fired over long distances.

Prerequisite(s): none.
