## Current Projects

### Rooms in AreaName

I have been working on some structured way to add room information to
the wiki. So far I've had nothing but compliments, so I figured I'd
encourage everyone else in joining me on this project by describing the
method..

-   First of all, all areas should have a subcategory \[\[Category:Rooms
    In AreaName\]\]. This should be categorised under
    [:Category:Rooms](:Category:Rooms "wikilink") and
    \[\[Category:AreaName\]\].
-   The next step is probably the hardest, but not the most work. A
    clickable map should be made at \[\[Template:Rooms In Areaname\]\].
    This template should be the first thing included in all rooms of the
    category, and in the \[\[Category:Rooms In AreaName\]\].
-   Then all the rooms need to be filled in, according to the [Template
    For Room Pages](Template_For_Room_Pages "wikilink").
-   Be sure to double-check if all of the rooms have different names for
    their wiki pages. If there's a logical arrangement among rooms with
    the same name, use that to name their wiki pages.

{.md\| border=1 \|- \| width=200px \| **Done** \| width=200px \| **To be
filled in** \|- \| [Rooms In
Necropolis](:Category:Rooms_In_Necropolis "wikilink") \| [Rooms In Oak
Circle](:Category:Rooms_In_Oak_Circle.md "wikilink") \|- \| [Rooms In
Stonehall](:Category:Rooms_In_Stonehall.md "wikilink") \| [Rooms In
Sanctum](:Category:Rooms_In_Sanctum.md "wikilink")  
(the pages need renaming, too) \|}

#### Suggestion

As this project is getting larger, it is becoming harder to locate pages
within the wiki via search. Maybe we could add some extra namespaces
(not pseudo-namespaces) to the project to handle, for instance, room
descriptions. It might also be good to make seperate namespaces for hero
gear and lord gear, so that searches are not filled with items from a
different tier.
