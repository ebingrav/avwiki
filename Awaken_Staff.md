By casting this spell, a Druid summmons a nature spirit or minor fae
which inhabits the staff, animating it to hover in palce around them.
Then, the druid can request the spirit brandish the staff by performing
a non-verbal cue which matches the spirit's personality. A graceful
Dryad, for instance, will brandish the staff upon seeing the Druid
dance, but different spirits respond to different cues.

Using a staff this way incurs the same lag as using one normally, but
allows the Druid to keep their held slot free for arrows and also
provides work for dryads in need.

If you have forgotten what type of spirit is presently assisting you,
recasting the spell will tell you.
