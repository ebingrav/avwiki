*Backstab is a particularly nasty way to start a fight. Although it can
be used only once per fight, Backstab delivers much more damage than is
normally inflicted with a weapon. A piercing weapon such as a dagger
must be [wielded](Wield "wikilink"). [BS](BS "wikilink") is a synonym
for Backstab. Backstab must be [practiced](Practice "wikilink") before
it can be used. Backstab is affected by your race's innate stealthiness.
Large or clumsy races may be spotted moving in for the kill.*

Prerequisite(s): [Rogue Lore](Rogue_Lore "wikilink"),
[Sneak](Sneak "wikilink").
