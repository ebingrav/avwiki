This "quest" involves murdering the (sanced) Fungal Forest residents
until they grow tired of you and [Psilocybin](Psilocybin "wikilink")
tries to bribe you to leave with a bag of gems, which contains about 1.6
million gold and also includes a perfect emerald.

As time progresses and you persist in killing them the myconoids will
grow more and more dangerous. They will start to use gas attacks and
other abilities, like toss, that were not previously used.

Having completed this quest you will receive the [Bane Of The Myconoids
Insignia](Bane_Of_The_Myconoids_Insignia "wikilink"). Any further entry
into Fungal Forest will draw a lot of attention towards the entire
group, so it is best to let your leader know immediately you are not
welcome there.

**Warning**: Completing this quest solo is very difficult even for
hogged berserkers or dragons. The major issue is that Fungal Forest is a
no-teleport-out area, and once a sufficient number of mobs become aggie
and start to hunt you down it can be difficult to get out alive.
