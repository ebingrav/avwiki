*You walk in and all you see is a wall directly in front of you with a
small hand-width slot to [put in money](Deposit "wikilink") and a slot
further down that has the potential to [slide money
out](Withdraw_(command) "wikilink"). Two beady eyes look out of one of
the slots and you hear a voice, 'Can I help you?' Your money is safe
here, to say the least. A sign on the wall gives instructions on how to
use the [bank](:Category:_Banks "wikilink").*

## Objects

## Comments

Contrary to popular belief its not the mobile in the room that acts like
the bank, but it is the room itself. So any transactions can be done
even if the mobile has been killed, or in any other way is missing.

The portal bank will take you to a number of possible mobs: the one in
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"), the one in
[Stonehall](:Category:_Stonehall "wikilink"), and the ent bank in
[Mervue](:Category:_Mervue "wikilink"). [Pansho](Pansho "wikilink") is
also a portal point for a bank.
