Syntax: cast 'banshee wail' (no target needed-area spell)

*It must've been shortly after midnight when Edmund awoke to the most
ghastly scream he had ever heard. Even from what seemed like the other
side of town he could still feel the air reverberating and pulsing in
its wake.*

*He snatched up his lantern and hastily made his way to the village gate
hoping to find the source of the commotion.*

*Instead all he found was a beautiful half-elf in a dazzling white cloak
standing among the obliterated wreckage of an orc raiding party. She
winked at him before blinking out of existence and leaving poor old Eddy
to explain this to the quickly gathering townsfolk.*

This spell causes **sonic and air damage.**
