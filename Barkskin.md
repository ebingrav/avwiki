*An account from Wyland the [Druid](:Category:_Druids.md "wikilink"):
After meditation and fasting, I was ready to reach that inner calm that
allows a [druid](:Category:_Druids.md "wikilink") to become a living
tree. This stasis is an experience reserved for those within the highest
Circles of magic. I was unsure if I was ready for this step, and in
truth that should have given me a hint, but I was young and ambitious to
be one with the forest. I began the incantation and sensed a wrongness
in my words. Small mistakes in inflection or possibly something I had
yet to learn, when I finished I was not a young Oak bending in the wind.
I was still Wyland, with skin made of rough bark. After several years of
study, I was able to remove the [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink")
and now it is a common practice among
[druids](:Category:_Druids.md "wikilink") for
[defense](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Buff_Characters.md "wikilink").
(Modifies [AC](Armor_Class.md "wikilink") by -30)*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'barkskin'
\<[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink")\>.

This [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") is rather valuable for
[buffing](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Buff_Characters.md "wikilink")
oneself or others.
