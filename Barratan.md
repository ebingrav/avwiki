*One of the most famed psitorturers of the Veil, Barratan the Tormentor
takes great pride in his ability to weave nightmares. He has already
snapped the sanity of the former captain of this ship with his twisted
dreams. After killing the captain and throwing the body to the beasts,
Barratan has now turned to the cabin boy for entertainment. An evil grin
is plastered across his face as he cackles gleefully. Too enthralled in
his hobby, he ignores you.*
