*You can barter with [shopkeepers](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink")
if you desire. The [shopkeeper](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink")
must desire the [item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") and feel it is
a good deal (in favor of the
[shopkeeper](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink")) before actually
agreeing to trade [item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") for
[item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink"). You will have poor luck
trading a shield for a necklace at the jeweller... why would a jeweller
want a shield?! You get the idea. If you can't normally
[sell](Sell.md "wikilink") the item at the
[shop](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink")... it is doubtful you can
barter that [type of item](:Category:_Object_Types.md "wikilink"). (An
exception being [treasure items](:Category:_Treasure.md "wikilink")!)
All trades are final... if you trade a 50,000 gold item for a 10 gold
item... you are stuck with it. Bartering doesn't give you change for the
difference.*

Syntax: barter \<[your object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")\>
\<[desired object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")\>.
