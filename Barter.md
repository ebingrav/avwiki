*You can barter with [shopkeepers](:Category:_Shopkeepers "wikilink") if
you desire. The [shopkeeper](:Category:_Shopkeepers "wikilink") must
desire the [item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") and feel it is a good
deal (in favor of the [shopkeeper](:Category:_Shopkeepers "wikilink"))
before actually agreeing to trade [item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")
for [item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"). You will have poor luck
trading a shield for a necklace at the jeweller... why would a jeweller
want a shield?! You get the idea. If you can't normally
[sell](Sell "wikilink") the item at the
[shop](:Category:_Shopkeepers "wikilink")... it is doubtful you can
barter that [type of item](:Category:_Object_Types "wikilink"). (An
exception being [treasure items](:Category:_Treasure "wikilink")!) All
trades are final... if you trade a 50,000 gold item for a 10 gold
item... you are stuck with it. Bartering doesn't give you change for the
difference.*

Syntax: barter \<[your object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")\>
