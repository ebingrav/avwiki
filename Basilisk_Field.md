## Comments

## Directions

''Most mobs in the Valley of the Sun wander around a bit, but in general
if you portal to [Giant Scorpion](Giant_Scorpion "wikilink"), you should
end up on the lower level of the valley (see [
Map](Valley_Of_The_Sun_Map "wikilink") for details.) From there, work
your way south until you get to "the base of the mountain" and go up
twice. The greater basilisk wanders around in this area. Kill it and
skin it to get the basilisk field.

'''Greater Basilisk is aggie, and I believe the desert basilisks will
assist against certain level characters.

'''Since the Greater Basilisk and Giant Scorpions both wander, it is
possible that your portal may not be safe.

'''Also, make sure not to accidentally wander into [Morte
Vallta](:Category:_Morte_Vallta "wikilink") while looking for the
greater basilisk, as the entrance is in the same area.
