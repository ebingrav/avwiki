*Crisp, short words and commands line only the first few lines of this
parchment. Veyah is direct and to the point in explaining to her general
commander how to repel the rumored drider invasion. She makes no
promises that the graveyard will not fall and does not sugarcoat the
situation, but rather states the hard, cold facts: if the driders come
in the numbers that are prophesied in the note given to her, the
graveyard will be lost.*

You will get this if you give [a note detailing the Drider
invasion](Note_Detailing_The_Drider_Invasion.md "wikilink") to the
[Statue Of Veyah L'Aturii](Statue_Of_Veyah_L'Aturii "wikilink").

If you give this note to [General Commander For Veyah
L'Aturii](General_Commander_For_Veyah_L'Aturii "wikilink"), you get the
following message:

*You give battle commands for Veyah's commander to the General Commander
for Veyah L'Aturii.  
* The general commander reads the note, his eyes scanning the parchment
as fast as they can. Finally, after he has read it thoroughly more than
a few times, he seems to remember that you are still standing there.  
*"Ah!" he exclaims. "I suppose you wish to see your reward? Well, here
you go, silly adventurer...Here you go, indeed."  
*He waves his hands, and the room spins wildly...

You are then transported to [The Hidden Room Of The
Necropolis](The_Hidden_Room_Of_The_Necropolis_(Necropolis).md "wikilink"),
where a [Projection Of Veyah
L'Aturii](Projection_Of_Veyah_L'Aturii "wikilink") sits.
