A slang term for a quantity of money, often decided to be 100 or 100,000
gold.

It was originally coined by the
[Solacian](:Category:Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink") alchemist Whyvor who
defined it as the amount of money gypsies would pay to take naughty
children off of their parents' hands, using his lazy nephew Benjamin as
a standard of measure. While it is unknown exactly how Whyvor calculated
this standard, the Solace public records show that his brother and
sister-in-law retired at an early age and now live comfortably on an
estate in [Mervue](:Category:Mervue.md "wikilink").
