*Bhyss is the god of death and destruction. To this end, this daemonic
diety desires nothing more than to destroy every living thing, including
you. Consign your body and soul to him and you may become a vessel of
his destructive magical power. Expect not a life outside this one
purpose however, for once you enter the dark house of Bhyss, you may
find yourself lacking the strength to escape.*
