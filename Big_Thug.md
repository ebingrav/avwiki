Ahrielle says 'Welcome Krinkle.'

Ahrielle stares in your eyes, then turns away and gazes into her crystal
ball.

Ahrielle frowns.

Ahrielle mutters something under her breath.

Ahrielle stares straight at you. You feel a little nervous.

Ahrielle says 'Krinkle...You must leave. A bad moon rises over you
and...'

Ahrielle shakes her head.

Ahrielle exclaims 'I see...A fight. Death. Yours? I cannot see. Too much
blood!'

Ahrielle points at the exit.

Ahrielle exclaims 'Leave! Now! Before the fortune becomes reality!'

Ahrielle suddenly shrieks very loudly.

A big thug's attacks haven't hurt you! A big thug is in excellent
condition.

The thug is clad in boiled black leather, with a spiked collar that cuts
into his flesh. His greasy black hair is slicked back, and his small
eyes focus on you. Though he looks more human than orc, it is easy to
see he has some mixed blood. His size for instance, and the enormous
muscles that he is flexing to show you he means business. And ofcourse
those sharp teeth that he shows you as he grins evilly. Perhaps this
really is your unlucky day.. A big thug is in perfect health.

A big thug is using: <wielded> knuckle dusters

You peek at the inventory:

`    Nothing.`

Ahrielle suddenly shrieks very loudly.
