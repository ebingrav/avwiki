*Binbinka, shaman of the Moonbay village, wraith behind his back. His
skin is a blueish hue, something to do with the steamy fog, constantly
enveloping the Moon Temple. They say every shaman has had blueish skin,
but not the blood-red, piercing eyes of Binbinka. The shaman has smooth
and hairless skin, except for his hands and arms. Up to his elbows are
overlapping scarred and burned tissue. Only the thick, orcish skin has
protected them from true harm. The mystery of their origins elude all.*
