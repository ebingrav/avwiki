*One of the most basic principles of Psionics is an enhanced awareness
of one's own body. This is what allows [students of
Psionics](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") to modify their own form
through [BIOCENTRIC
spells](:Category:_Biocentric_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") such as
[REGENERATION](Regeneration "wikilink") and
[BIOFEEDBACK](Biofeedback "wikilink"). After learning Bio Empathy, you
can effect those same BIOCENTRIC changes in other people. The trick is
as hard to learn as many
[psionicists](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") say, but the principle
is easy: you become as familiar with others' bodies as you are with your
own.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: none (automatic).
