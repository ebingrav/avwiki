*The blade of the sword is a full meter long, and straight as an arrow,
with lightly fluted sides. Both edges keened down to perfect lines,
invisibly sharp. Perfection like this could have only been forged by a
god. The black hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white
arrow. Upon the blade is engraved a poem:*  
   *Farslayer howls across the world*  
   *For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!*  
   *Vengeance is his who casts the blade*  
   *Yet he will in the end no triumph see.*

## Directions

Found in the [Living Wall](Living_Wall "wikilink") room, 1s 3e of (0)
[Guardian Of Hell](Guardian_Of_Hell "wikilink") on the map.

Seems to be 3 living walls that pop, the one in the living wall room I
noted, and 2 more in another that have angel skulls instead of the
sword.

Wall with the sword didn't repop until I killed the two with the skulls.

Walls also cast gear damaging spells.
