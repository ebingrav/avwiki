## Comments

This gear is in the Alien Hive, on the [Drow
Captain](Drow_Captain "wikilink") and
[Lieutenants](Drow_Lieutenant.md "wikilink"). It needs to be
[faded](Fading.md "wikilink"). Note that even though the drow in the
Hive use one in the wield and offhand slot, both swords have the same
weight, so most characters will not be able to
[balance](Balance.md "wikilink") them.

## Directions

Portal to [Terrified Woman](Terrified_Woman "wikilink"), and walk w n e.
Use the [map](Alien_Hive_Map.md "wikilink") to find your way down to the
second sublevel, and head west (this is the very bottom portion of the
map). Find the Drow Captain or the Lieutenants and kill them for the
sword. They carry a large amount of cursed gear, so keep autoloot off if
you are not interested in the rest of it. Note that many mobs aggie and
there is a tremendous range in levels, so you would be wise to stay
hidden, invis, sneaking and using passdoor whenever possible.
