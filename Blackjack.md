*A well placed sock to the back of the neck, and even the staunchest
guard will crumble like [goblin](Goblins.md "wikilink") architecture.
This is the perfect time to [borrow](Steal.md "wikilink")
[belongings](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") or
[gold](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink") from lenders who might otherwise be
stingy. Several [Rogue guilds](Rogue_Guild_Terrain.md "wikilink") make
liberal use of blackjacks to keep outsiders away. There is, of course, a
chance the attack will fail, mostly depending on the quality of the
blackjack being used. Although blackjacks are weapon-like, they are
totally useless in a melee, so blackjacks are considered [rogue
tools](:Category:_Rogue_Tools.md "wikilink"), and not
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") items. Since blackjacking
knocks targets out so fast, the [rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink")
can generally escape [legal troubles](Outlaw_Flag.md "wikilink"), unless
another [guard](Townguard_Mobs.md "wikilink") or
[citizen](Citizen_Mobs.md "wikilink") catches him in the act. Blackjack
is affected by your [race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink")'s innate
stealthiness. Large or clumsy [races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink")
may be spotted moving in for the kill.*

Prerequisite(s): [Rogue Lore](Rogue_Lore.md "wikilink").
