''The Blade Weave is a series of moves which may be woven into any of
the Bladedancers attacks and dances. These additional, swift flourishes
create more opportunities for the bladedancer to strike their opponent.

As with the Sublime Flow technique, two identical, lightweight cutting
weapons (of either slicing or slashing weapon type), are required to
perform this technique. In addition, the bladedancer must have entered a
bladetrance.

The maximum weight of cutting weapons useable with this skill may be
viewed with the abilities command, once Blade Weave has been practiced.

The effects of this technique are enhanced if it is used while under the
effects of a bladetrance. The deeper the trance, the more swiftly she
will respond to her opponent's attacks, thus landing even more of her
own with each hand.''
