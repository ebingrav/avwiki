*All [Stormlord](:Category:_Stormlords.md "wikilink")
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") manipulate weather in a very
localized manner. They can call forth a blizzard in the middle of a
summer meadow, or a shower of rain while miles underground. They must be
sustained, and will end early if the caster is struck, moved, or enters
a command. Blizzard calls forth weather of the same name, pelting all
the [Stormlord](:Category:_Stormlords.md "wikilink")'s enemies with
torrents of jagged ice. Blizzard's affects may linger briefly after the
spell ends, but will not do any damage while the caster is not directly
controlling it.*
