*A heart-shaped core of solid blood mithril is here.*  
**Keywords**: blood mithril core  
**Type**: ticket  
**Flags**: nolocate  
**Plane**: [Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia "wikilink")  
**Area**: [Shiftwatch Orb](:Category:Shiftwatch_Orb "wikilink")  
**Mob**: [Iron Claw Sniper](Iron_Claw_Sniper "wikilink")  
Originally, to get the mob with this item to appear, you needed to kill
the four [Iron Claw Snipers](Iron_Claw_Sniper "wikilink") that surround
[Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia "wikilink") shift.

As of November 2011, the procedure appears to have changed slightly. The
leading theories involve killing all of the [Iron Claw
Sentinels](Iron_Claw_Sentinel "wikilink"). While killing the snipers is
no longer sufficient, it may still be necessary.

I cleared the orb, and when it repopd it spawned the sniper holding the
core and war machine bow. on further clears and repops I wasn't able to
get the mob to spawn. Is it reboot only?
