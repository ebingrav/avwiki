*A reforged blood-mithril key is ready to unlock ancient secrets.*  

`Object 'reforged blood mithril key' type key, extra flags glow hum dark magic.`  
`Weight 2, value 9300, level 125.`  
`Object Quality (17 / 25 hps)`

There are also blood-mithril keys in Noctopia. The one for Bo'Vul's
Vault has the keyword "reforged".

This key is used to enter the vault north of the bank (where you
complete Bo'Vul's Treasure quest and modify items with demonic lapis
lazulis) and to also enter Bo'Vul's vault area in Airscape via Tormak.

If you want to copy this key to save money (it costs almost 100k to
purchase), it needs to be cleansed by a priest first to remove the magic
flag. Magic keys cannot be copied.
