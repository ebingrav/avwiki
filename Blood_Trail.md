*Those intimately familiar with nature can learn to locate corpses by
the telltale scent of death and blood. At first, those skilled in
[scenting blood](Blood_Scent.md "wikilink") can are only capable of
following their own scent to a kill-zone, but those who master the more
difficult skill of blood trail can also locate the corpses of other
players. A blood scent or trail will always lead to the most recent
corpse that matches the target, since the most recently created corpse
will have the freshest trail. Tracking takes time; there are delays
whenever a user moves and has to relocate the trail. The
[bloodhound](Bloodhound.md "wikilink")
[skill](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") can help speed the
process.*

Prerequisite(s): none.
