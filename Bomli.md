*Good old Bomli, broad of shoulder, hip and wallet, a smile never far
from his elaborately bearded face. Scant months after opening his humble
bar, a new vein of precious durrite was found in the mines close by. The
traders descended in droves from the [human](Humans.md "wikilink")
cities, needing lodgings and somewhere to do business while in [Mt
Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr.md "wikilink"). Bomli was only too happy to
oblige. Knowing a good thing when he saw it, Bomli expanded, hired the
best musicians and entertainers and now runs the most successful
wayhouse for many a mile.*
