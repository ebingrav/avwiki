    Recently, leaflets like this have been found scattered about
    the Meadow, nailed to the Tree of Knowledge and even glued
    to Fred the Beagle. Less than impressed at all of this, Nom
    has been heard to comment "What are those bonkers pixies up
    to now? No good, I'll be bound."

    (As Bonk will tell you PUNCTUATION is important, be sure when you do the say portion you say bonk bonk!)

    Clearly what is needed here is an enterprising adventurer
    of no higher than level 10 to go and infiltrate the Cult
    and sort out this current spate of pixie nuttiness.

The quest awards the [Stark Raving Bonkers!
Insignia](Stark_Raving_Bonkers!_Insignia "wikilink").  
Spoiler:<spoiler>Be sure you bonk [tiamat](Spoiled_Brat.md "wikilink"),
[Goblin King](Goblin_King "wikilink"), and [Simba The Apple
Picker](Simba_The_Apple_Picker "wikilink") 3 times. Otherwise you will
receive a weapon instead of the insignia.</spoiler>
