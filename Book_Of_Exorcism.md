*You give the Book of Exorcism to the Chief Librarian.*  
*"Excellent!" shouts the Librarian from behind his desk.*  
  
*"This is precisely the book I need to rid the Library of these*  
*pesky poltergeists! You have my thanks, CharacterName. Examine*  
*the Book of Merrighand in the Ancient Gods Section for a*  
*further clue!"*  
You will be transferred to "The Cleric Guild's Prayer Room" In Temple Of
Midgaard and this is all you need to do for the wizard quest.

**Note:**The bit about checking the ancient gods section is a broken
quest to do with the old Gf'd library quest. (Edit if I am wrong)
