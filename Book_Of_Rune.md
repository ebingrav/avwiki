Note: There are actually 3 domes and 3 gold disks in the underground
area. Each gold disk unlocks 1 of 3 doors down to the where Shiaana is.

The mobs at the lower level are big, generally over level 80, some are
in sanctuary, and all of them hit very hard. This quest is quite
difficult to solo at any level.
