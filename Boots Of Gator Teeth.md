*These boots seem to be made out of Gator Teeth. The teeth gleam in the
moonlight. Someone with a lot of time on their hands has interlocked the
teeth together to form a pair of boots. They don't look to be very
comfortable. As you slip your feet into them, you feel a very soft fur
lining stretch to match your foot.*
