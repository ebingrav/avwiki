*The [Immortals](:Category:_Immortals "wikilink") of the Realm have the
power to issue a bounty on the head of an
[inhabitant](:Category:_Characters "wikilink"). Issuing a bounty
immediately makes the bountied
[player](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") an
[Outlaw](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink") of the Realm. Unlike a regular
[Outlaw](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink"), a bountied
[player](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") can be killed by any other
[player](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") with no repercussions.
Bounties can be [experience](Experience_Points "wikilink"),
[gold](Gold_In_Hand "wikilink") or
[practices](Practice_Points "wikilink").*
