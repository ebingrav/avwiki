*The [Immortals](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink") of the Realm have
the power to issue a bounty on the head of an
[inhabitant](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"). Issuing a bounty
immediately makes the bountied
[player](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") an
[Outlaw](Outlaw_Flag.md "wikilink") of the Realm. Unlike a regular
[Outlaw](Outlaw_Flag.md "wikilink"), a bountied
[player](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") can be killed by any other
[player](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") with no repercussions.
Bounties can be [experience](Experience_Points.md "wikilink"),
[gold](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink") or
[practices](Practice_Points.md "wikilink").*
