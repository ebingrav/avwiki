*BRANDISH brandishes a [magical staff](:Category:Staves "wikilink"). You
must HOLD a staff before using BRANDISH. This command uses up the staff.
Staves have multiple charges. When a magical object has no more charges,
it will be consumed. One must be adept with the "[arcane
knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge "wikilink")" skill to be able to brandish
items.*

offensive spells affecting all mobs in a room, and healing spells
affecting all players in a room.
