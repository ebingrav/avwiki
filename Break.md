*It is possible to break open some [containers and
chests](:Category:_Containers.md "wikilink") with the use of raw, brute
force and a [heavy](Object_Weight.md "wikilink"), [crushing
weapon](:Category:_Melee_Weapons_That_Crush.md "wikilink"). However,
this is far from an exact science. It is almost inevitable that the
[weapon](:Category:_Melee_Weapons.md "wikilink") and the
[chest](:Category:_Containers.md "wikilink")'s contents will take
[damage](Object_Quality.md "wikilink"), sometimes even be destroyed.
Banging on [chests](:Category:_Containers.md "wikilink") with big
hammers is also pretty much guaranteed to set off any
[traps](Container_Values.md "wikilink") that may be present. Note that
some [containers](:Category:_Containers.md "wikilink") are [magically
unbreakable](Container_Values.md "wikilink").*

Syntax: break \<[container](:Category:_Containers.md "wikilink")\>.
