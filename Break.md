*It is possible to break open some [containers and
chests](:Category:_Containers "wikilink") with the use of raw, brute
force and a [heavy](Object_Weight "wikilink"), [crushing
weapon](:Category:_Melee_Weapons_That_Crush "wikilink"). However, this
is far from an exact science. It is almost inevitable that the
[weapon](:Category:_Melee_Weapons "wikilink") and the
[chest](:Category:_Containers "wikilink")'s contents will take
[damage](Object_Quality "wikilink"), sometimes even be destroyed.
Banging on [chests](:Category:_Containers "wikilink") with big hammers
is also pretty much guaranteed to set off any
[traps](Container_Values "wikilink") that may be present. Note that some
[containers](:Category:_Containers "wikilink") are [magically
unbreakable](Container_Values "wikilink").*

Syntax: break \<[container](:Category:_Containers "wikilink")\>.
