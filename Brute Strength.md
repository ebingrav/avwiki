*Brute Strength acts much like [enhanced
damage](Enhanced_Damage "wikilink"), except that it only functions when
the user is in direct combat (ie fighting the
[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") that's fighting you) and has worse
than -750 [AC](Armor_Class "wikilink") at
[Hero](:Category:_Hero "wikilink") and -1250 at
[Lord](:Category:Lord "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Enhanced Damage](Enhanced_Damage "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
