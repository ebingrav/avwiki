*Brute Strength acts much like [enhanced
damage](Enhanced_Damage.md "wikilink"), except that it only functions
when the user is in direct combat (ie fighting the
[mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") that's fighting you) and has worse
than -750 [AC](Armor_Class.md "wikilink") at
[Hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") and -1250 at
[Lord](:Category:Lord.md "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Enhanced Damage](Enhanced_Damage.md "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
