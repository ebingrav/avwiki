*A heavy bucket is filled with gray ore.*

*This bucket is flat on one side, with a leather harness attached for
carrying it on one's back. It is filled with large red-brown stones,
covered in blotches of shining silver-gray metal: no doubt hematite ore
destined for the furnace.*

## Comments

Found on the ground in the room "An exposed vein of hematite" with
[Ferromancer Cindris](Ferromancer_Cindris "wikilink").

Drop this in room "Above the mouth of the furnace" to spawn A [Newly
Formed Ironbeast](Newly_Formed_Ironbeast "wikilink")("Still bright and
fluid from the forge, yellow molten iron takes shape!!") in the "Pools
of Iron" rooms.

When killed, that mob yields about 460 xp solo and drops the [Glowing
Soul of a Fire Giant](Glowing_Soul_of_a_Fire_Giant "wikilink"), a level
51 item which may be given to [White Raven Alighting
Unseen](White_Raven_Alighting_Unseen "wikilink") for the Fiery Aura
insignia (+15% death xp reduction; +2% hp regeneration; modifies melee
attacks with fire damage).
