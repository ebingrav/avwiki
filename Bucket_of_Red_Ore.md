Carried by various giants throughout the area, including a [Driven Fire

Drop this in room "Above the mouth of the furnace" to show a message
which appears to be a hint for the insignia-related quests with [Bucket
of Black Ore](Bucket_of_Black_Ore "wikilink"), \[Bucket of Gray Ore\]\],
and [Bucket of Iron Scale](Bucket_of_Iron_Scale "wikilink"). This
appears to have no other effect.

` A bucketful of red ore pours off the precipice, and into the blast furnace.`  
` Beyond a brief billow of acrid smoke, nothing particularly interesting`  
` happens as the fresh batch mingles with the melted ore.`
