*This deep gnome has tied his long beard into a knot to keep it out of
his way as he fiddles with various concoctions. He seems to be working
on several different projects at once and interested in just about
anything of a magical nature. From time to time to time he has been
known to reward those who bring him the rare magical ingredients he
needs to continue his studies.*
