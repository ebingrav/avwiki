'RULES-CAMPING' CAMPING

Camping means to sit within a room for a duration of time. This has
different meanings at different levels and what is accepted changes. We
try to have plenty of good mobiles to kill for everyone but that is
never the case. That means you all need to be polite to some extent and
\*share\*.

You CAN camp at healers and regen. Feel free. Sitting in a room is not
illegal unless you are a Lord abusing a flaw in an area. If a Lord is
doing this, it should be reported to an IMM.

You CANNOT be greedy with mobiles and kill them over and over, hogging
whatever experience or gear they may have. If someone is doing this, it
should be reported to an IMM.

You CAN camp for 1 or 2 repops on non-quest mobiles. It is a question of
allowing everyone to have a shot at the thing you feel is so great. It
probably is and everyone should play "nice".

You SHOULD ask to kill a mobile if someone is in the room camping.
Unless you have been watching the person kill the same mobile over 2
times while you wait your turn, they have a right to be there. If they
are simply sitting there regenning and cannot kill the mobile in the
next minute or two, they hopefully will tell you to go ahead and they'll
catch the next one.

If someone is not following these guidelines, try to reference this help
file and solve it amongst themselves unless it it something that should
be reported. IMMs are always available for mediation, of course, but
like good gear mobiles, we are rare.
