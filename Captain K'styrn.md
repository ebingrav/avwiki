*Captain K'styrn is the field leader of the Serpent clan armies. Only
the prince of the clan holds a higher military rank than he. He is a
tall man, with a scarred face from many battles. His eyes are black, and
they hold the cold memories of conquest after conquest, death upon
death, bloodshed spilling over bloodshed. Pray that you are not the next
notch on his never-ending list of killings.*
