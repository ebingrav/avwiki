*This stout warrior is unusually burly, even for a dwarf. He and his
crew were sent by Silverbeard to take care of the goblins in the Walking
Woods, but were ill prepared when they found themselves surrounded by
the undead. It looks like a wound on his left arm is suffering the same
affliction as the undead ents and goblins, but his above-average
constitution seems to be keeping the sickness at bay. Nevertheless, the
captain and his party need to escape to safety as soon as possible.*
