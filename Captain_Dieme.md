*His exhausted appearance indicates that the captain has been on Gorn's
Anchor for entirely too long. "And who are you," he demands. "Bah,
you're the least of my worries. That mayor needs to... reevaluate his
priorities very soon. Hmm. While you're here, and seeing who I'm tired
of tip-toing around the real issue, why don't you make my wishes
perfectly clear to the mayor. Gorn's Anchor will be under the control of
Lord Audis. Very very soon. It would be in the interest of the entire
village to cooperate." The captain chuckles to himself as he settles
back down into his paperwork, mumbling something about an interloper.*
