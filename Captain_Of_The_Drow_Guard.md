*The captain's suffering is perhaps greater than that of the other
guards. After many years of guarding [this
place](:Category:_Frozen_Court.md "wikilink") against intruders, he has
forgotten the sound of laughter. For the first few years of his new
position, the laughter of the children of the once-great city echoed in
his memory, along with the promise that life would return to normal.
Now, all that was seems like a far-away, impossible dream.*
