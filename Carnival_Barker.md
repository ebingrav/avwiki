*A bulky man, about as round as he is tall stands before you,
bellowing:  
*"Step right up! Come and see the carnival! Witness the freaks!  
*Wrestle with the bear! Joust against a knight! What are you waiting
for?  
*Be amazed by our fire-eaters and acrobats!  
*Come see the latest plays written by the playwright of the kings!  
*And come on all jester lovers!  
*We got funny jesters, boring jesters, silly jesters, goofy jesters!  
*We even got sarcastic jesters, political jesters, slapstick jesters!  
*Come on, you want jesters, come on in jester lovers!  
*If we don't got it you don't want it!"

`A barker stands here, loudly telling you about all the atractions.`
