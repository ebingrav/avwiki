**Syntax: cast 'castigate undead' <victim>**

*Divine casters of advanced skills have the power to castigate the
undead. This powerful single target spell shares certain characteristics
with ritual spells as cumulative successful casts on a single target
will cause escalating damage to the victim.*

*Each caster will find their initial cast to be easy to damage the
victim however subsequent casts will be more difficult on a per caster
basis. Casters benefitting from Divine Adjutant will receive a bonus in
this regard.*

*Druids will also notice their green arrows work especially well with
victims under castigation.*
