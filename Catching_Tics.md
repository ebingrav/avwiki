Catching tics is an effective way for grouped spellcasters like
[mages](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink") and
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics.md "wikilink") to somewhat alleviate
[mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink") shortages during runs--a problem that
especially afflicts low-[hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink")
spellcasters. This technique involves
[sleeping](Sleep_(command).md "wikilink") periodically just as a fight
begins and then [waking](Wake.md "wikilink") either just after a
[tic](Tics.md "wikilink") has passed or just before one's group moves
(often cued by receiving [experience
points](Experience_Points.md "wikilink")). By being asleep when a
[tic](Tics.md "wikilink") occurs, sleeping spellcasters will regenerate
a small amount of [mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink") to use. This
technique may be dangerous in some
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") like [Shadow
Keep](:Category:_Shadow_Keep.md "wikilink") where
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink")-[wimpy](Wimpy_Mobs.md "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") will attack sleeping
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink").

It is highly recommended to put the time in your prompt to help you
catch tics. They occur on average every 30 seconds. This is equivalent
to 6 rounds of combat.
