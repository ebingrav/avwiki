Catching tics is an effective way for grouped spellcasters like
[mages](:Category:_Mages "wikilink") and
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") to somewhat alleviate
[mana](Mana_Points "wikilink") shortages during runs--a problem that
especially afflicts low-[hero](:Category:_Hero "wikilink") spellcasters.
This technique involves [sleeping](Sleep_(command) "wikilink")
periodically just as a fight begins and then [waking](Wake "wikilink")
either just after a [tic](Tics "wikilink") has passed or just before
one's group moves (often cued by receiving [experience
points](Experience_Points "wikilink")). By being asleep when a
[tic](Tics "wikilink") occurs, sleeping spellcasters will regenerate a
small amount of [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink") to use. This technique
may be dangerous in some [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") like
[Shadow Keep](:Category:_Shadow_Keep "wikilink") where
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")-[wimpy](Wimpy_Mobs "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") will attack sleeping
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink").

It is highly recommended to put the time in your prompt to help you
catch tics. They occur on average every 30 seconds. This is equivalent
to 6 rounds of combat.
