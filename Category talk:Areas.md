I like this category, but we need to put all of the areas in it, even if
they're tagged in one of the other Area subcategories.

\*nod\* I worked my way through levels 1-10 I think, will try and add
the others in order of level so as to hopefully avoid missing
any.--[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop "wikilink") 09:25, 31 Oct 2005 (EST)

I just got my hands on all of Mindesto's maps of areas. Before I start
uploading them I figured I would get some consensus....should I link to
them directly from each area's category page (as I have been doing) or
should I create new articles "Map Of Areaname" and put the maps there?

I like the maps on the pages themselves, if there is no particular
reason to have the off somewhere else. Personally, I prefer them at the
bottom of the page though as it means people have to at least glance at
the text info which has been added to the various wiki pages before
scrolling down.--[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop "wikilink") 06:44, 3 Nov

I like them on the area page themselvs too, I even linked one of them as
an example too. --[Mel](User:Mel "wikilink") 11:08, 3 Nov 2005 (EST)

Here's my justification for putting maps on their own nodes:

-   Some of the maps are huge, so depending on browser they'll either
    dwarf the rest of the content of the page, or you'll have to click
    on them to be able to make out any useful details.
-   I feel that it's easier to link together the maps if they're on
    their own nodes. Lack of map linking is the main problem with
    outland.org's implementation of these maps.
-   Individual map pages will be linked to from their areas, since
    they're in the appropriate area category, so it's not like it will
    be inconvenient to access the map from the area's page.
-   Having them on their own page keeps the area pages from getting
    cluttered with too much content.
-   It also allows us to have a category:maps, so you can quickly browse
    all the areas with maps

Unless you guys feel really strongly about this, I suggest playing nice
and going along with the precedent I started. It'll be awesome when
we've got it all hooked together, I promise :)

Fair enough. I liked having a visual on the area pages, but as you say,
some of them are far too big and make the pages look a bit blah. I
really like the links from one map page to another. Anything which makes
navigating the side easier is good in my
opinion.--[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop "wikilink") 06:29, 4 Nov 2005 (EST)

## Area sorting?

I thought it was wiki policy that pages shouldn't be placed in both
category and subcategory of the same branch? Yet for areas, there seems
to be a consensus to do the opposite. All areas are categorised under
[Areas](:Category:Areas "wikilink") and also per level range. I'd
propose this is changed to reflect the way the rest of the wiki is
organized. --[Llanor](User:MooNFisH "wikilink") 03:44, 15 May 2007 (CDT)

I'm sure Waite would have the final say but I'm fine with this idea - it
makes sense categorically. Then I would put a link to the
[Areas](:Category:Areas "wikilink") section on the navigation panel on
the left. My 2 cents... --[Ylem](User:Ylem "wikilink") 10:25, 15 May

Sounds like a good idea. Right now my autmatic wiki editing scripts
aren't working very well. I'll tinker with them later unless someone
beats me to the task of tidying up this category.

Done. And it looks so clean :) --[Llanor](User:MooNFisH "wikilink")
