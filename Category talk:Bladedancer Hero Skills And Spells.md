Just a minor note, over half of these changes you made were pointless,
Dave. The wiki automatically changes the first letter of a link to an
uppercase link, so any of the \[\[Randomword\|randomword\]\] actually
better left as \[\[randomword\]\], since it saves space on the server.

I simply copied-and-pasted the Rogue Hero Skills And Spells content and
edited it slightly based upon the info that you provided. Good point
about wasted space. Then again, I don't think that Waite or Mel are too
concerned about server space at this time; I've been bugging Waite to
"take out the trash" (pages, categories, images, and such that need
deleting) for more than a year now (hee-hee). --[Dave
