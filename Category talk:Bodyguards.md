*<I>Since Bodyguards usually worship gods that increase the number of
practices they need to adept, they can leave many spells at 94%, since
failure rates on most Bodyguard races is very high.</i>*

So if the failure rate is high, wouldn't that extra 1% be important at
all?--[Arcano](User:Arcano "wikilink") 15:51, 9 September 2006 (CDT)

Is there a fixed number for the low intelligence requirement?

I'm pretty the maximum int you can have and still become a bodyguard is
15. I seem to remember someone telling me that a completely uneducated
centaur could go bod, but a dragon could not.
