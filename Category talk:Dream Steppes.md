not to sound elitist (how can I, I don't even have a lord!), but why is
this area popular for lowhero? the mobs aren't particulary rewarding;
they seem to have comparable hp/attack/defense to Greed's Gallows mobs,
but give xp more in line with Shadow Keep
mobs.--[Arcano](User:Arcano "wikilink") 01:45, 11 October 2006 (CDT)

The main reason is that lowheroes don't like aggies. I'll agree that
this area isn't the best for exp, but it's handy for a lowhero tank to
know of multiple places to run. If you only know how to kill rotting
corpses then you're going to be in a jam when that area has been cleared
by some other group. Perhaps it would be useful for us to write an
article listing all the areas where it's safe for lowheroes to run.

Also, any area that lowhero groups run can be easily soloed by higher
level heroes. (or lowheroes surging or war/arc/rog with quaffies)
