Ok - I'm mapping this place and I've got the islands down with the
fountains. However when I do a "where p" I got a mob called "the
pretender". I also found "a wave mephit". Obviously the description of
the merchant indicates a letter is somewhere. The only mobs I've not
beaten so far are the 5 samurai so maybe one of them has it. Anyone more
familiar with this area? Any hints? Thanks!
