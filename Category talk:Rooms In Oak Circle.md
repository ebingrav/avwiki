It looks like I'm the only one who puts time and effort into the making
of these maps. Are they unnecessary, or aren't there people willing to
invest time in this kind of work? Cause I'd like to know if they're not
necessary. --[Llanor](User:MooNFisH "wikilink") 02:19, 9 June 2007 (EDT)

I'll be honest - I more partial to the graphics ones. Since it seems I'm
the only other one on here mapping areas (currently working on Silmavar)
I'll say that I don't think the ASCII representation quite holds the
benefit from the amount of work put into it. Nor does going from room to
room and documenting each room gain much. Smaller areas it is not so bad
but I sure as heck would not want to do it on a large area (like Alien
Hive). So if you are looking for a vote - I'll vote no.
