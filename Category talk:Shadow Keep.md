I've got a number of pages saved from my old Av site/wiki before it died
that I'd be willing to incorporate into this site, if that's okay. I'll
try to merge the edits where possible, but in this particular case just
about everything was already covered in the writeup I had.

I haven't been active in Av for over a year, so some of the info may be
dated as well. I also don't have access to Av so I can't help with
anything not in my backup (like the name of the 9/9 piercer mentioned in
the writeup). Hopefully I can provide a foundation to quite a few of
your pages though.

Feel free to revert if you don't like :)

`What is the ticket quest the `[`Hunter`](Hunter "wikilink")` is part of? I just noticed it last night, and looking at him shows a description about needing a head of a wolf from the north. So yea, anyone know? I'm assuming that's from icewolf type area, but I'm just curious what the reward is.`

If I remember correctly, the reward is an interesting poison. The quest
is pretty fun and fairly lengthy, though it requires an archer. -Masa

I got a nice venom from the hunter by using a ticket i found somewhere
on one of the islands out in the sea. not very lengthy and no wolves or
archers needed. He seems to be involed in several quests tho i still
have not solved the one with the wolf.

Well, you broke the sequence and skipped to the end, so the quest seemed
short. :p If I recall correctly, there is a wolf with unique eyes in
[Frozen Wastes](:Category:Frozen_Wastes "wikilink"). You need to look at
the description of the mob to see the information about the eyes.
Skinning that mob's corpse produces a ticket. Giving that ticket to the
[Hunter](Hunter_(Shadow_Keep) "wikilink") results in getting a clue to
go look in the [Island of Utami](:Category:_Island_Of_Utami "wikilink")
for the rest of the quest. If anyone is interested, s/he can go take a
look and fill in the Wiki if desired.
