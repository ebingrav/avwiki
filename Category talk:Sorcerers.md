I moved the discussion about double remorts to the "remort" section
rather than creation. Seemed more appropriate there.

Tuataurs are a bad choice for sor remort? on what evidence? apart from
no arcane bonus I can't see why tua are not a viable sor remort? yeah I
know Im biased but explain --[Redwinter](User:Redwinter "wikilink")

I'd say that statement is wrong. Updating the article.

I'll yield to your experiences. I haven't played a Tua, and what I had
originally heard was they were great for Psi-based classes, but not for
casters. Sorry for jumping in line out of turn ;)
