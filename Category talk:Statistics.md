I don't understand the table you added, Neyne. What do the values
represent? You're distinguishing 'Prime Req' and 'Other'. I'm assuming
by prime req you mean the primary stat for a certain class, and by other
you mean the other four. And then, in order to raise the value from stat
value A to stat value B, where B is listed in the colored part of the
table, it costs what is listed below?  
I'd say it'd make a lot more sense to specify the cost it would require
to raise your stat from value A to value B, with A in the table above
the cost to raise. But, again, I'm not sure which of the two you're
using here. I like the idea of a table like this, though.

[Prime Requisite](Prime_Requisite "wikilink") is what Neyne is referring
to. The table makes sense to me, but "Stat Type" could be changed to
"Stat Value" to accurately reflect what it is.

Actually, "Stat Type" refers to the column, not the row. It's not
formatted obviously, but I can't think of a better way to do it, so I'm
thinking the field might be better left empty.

Yes, this table lists the cost to raise a stat TO what is
listed.--[Neyne](User:Neyne "wikilink") 16:23, 15 February 2007 (CST)
