Here is the description of the UnMaker.

Behind the maw you can make out some semblance of a body, coated in a
black, oily substance, armed with short, vestigial limbs.

Feeding from the littler Chaos Beasts, this abomination has been drawing
off the disintegrating energies of both Arcadia and Noctopia. The Faerie
Essence of both realms churns in its belly, covering it in a vibrating
aura of resonant energy. Anyone who doesn't possess a matching energy
signature may not be able to survive even its slightest touch.

(Black Aura) Coruscating light surrounds a gaping maw.
