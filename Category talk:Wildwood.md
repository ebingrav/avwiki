Maybe I'm just stupid, but does anyone know the purpose of the Gateway
(as marked on the map)2nw2sws3w3nenenw from Shen? It's locked, the
"ivory key" is what opens it, and appearantly:

`These huge doors are solid mahogany, and bound with great silvery braces.`  
`They appear hugely massive, yet they shift easily, as if perfectly`  
`balanced.`  
`The gateway is closed.`

Look gateway produces:

`The unkillable kzin guardian beyond this gate will destroy you - and you will`  
`NOT be reimbursed if you pass these gates without immortal aid.`

So I'm assuming this is some IMM thing, but still fun.

I know what you're talking about, but I've never heard of anyone getting
through there. Would probably be a fun place to use that psi spell that
lets you look through doors. [Waite](User:Waite "wikilink") 09:57, 4
