*The [Master Of This Hell](Master_Of_This_Hell "wikilink"), in the flip
side of [Greed's Gallows](:Category:Greed's_Gallows.md "wikilink") is
rumored to have a private realm - a devilish maze of heat and stone
walls that sweat blood, which few have seen and fewer still have managed
to leave.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested: pod man.

brandish the [Mystic Dragoon's Control
Wand](Mystic_Dragoon's_Control_Wand "wikilink"), which will transport
the group to the first room of the area. This means certain classes will
not be able to enter the area by themselves (Berserker, Black Circle
Initiate).
