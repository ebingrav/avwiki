*The bearded devil Abishai is remembered by scholars as the father of
Trolls. Since his disappearance, most of his shrines have fallen into
disrepair, and even the Trolls have largely abandoned his worship. Rumor
speaks of a high mountain pass where the few remaining faithful Trolls
gather.*

## Adventuring

Not recommended for heroes under 400 if soloing, and even a duo can be
problematic given the tendency towards walk-ins and the sneaky nature of
a few of the mobs.

The howler wraith is arguably the most lucrative at roughly 2800-3000xp
solo (pre-revision), but it has sanc, is invis, casts unrest, blindness
& torment, and hits very hard. The stonewolves and trolls account for
the bulk of the mobs in this area, though the Apex Harpies are also
fairly abundant the further up you go. They longshot and these arrows
hit extremely hard, not to mention there's usually 3 a room, so they're
best avoided altogether.

Stonewolves bash, cast blindness, and use other warlord specs; trolls
simply hit hard. Worth 1200-1500 solo prior to xp revision.

The only advantage of this area over Aculeata is its linear nature and
the proximity of the safe rooms to the entrance, making CRs easier.

A wolf is now worth about 700xp.
