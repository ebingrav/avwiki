*Lore tells of a hole in a cave under a [lizard infested
bog](:Category:_Crescent_Bog "wikilink") so incredibly deep and wide
that it could only have been made by the passing of a huge creature.
Indead, there are now many gigantic insects inhabiting this underground
chasm where only foolish mortals tread.*

**Level Range:** 48-50

**Builder:** Slinky

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 16e, \[e\], 2e, n, e,
2n, 2w, 2n, 2w, 5n, 3d, 2w, d.

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Tapeworm](Long_Tapeworm "wikilink").

## Connections

The Abyss connects to the [Crescent
Bog](:Category:_Crescent_Bog "wikilink") above it via an
[underwater](Water_Terrain "wikilink") cave. At present, it connects
with no other [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink").

## Navigation

The Abyss centers around a tall vertical shaft that characters must [be
flying](Flying_Flag "wikilink") to traverse. This shaft's topmost room
exits upward into an [underwater](Water_Terrain "wikilink") room within
the [Crescent Bog](:Category:_Crescent_Bog "wikilink"); so, if you
suddenly find yourself in a water room while navigating this area, then
you've gone too far up. The [tapeworm](Long_Tapeworm "wikilink") usually
stands stationary just below this top entrance, though sometimes it
appears in the bottommost room of this shaft. About midway down this
shaft is a level where it connects with four toyshop room, one in each
cardinal direction.

On most other levels, one or two rooms adjoin this shaft, each of these
containing a single stationary giant insect; from each of these lairs,
one exit returns to this shaft *on the same level* while another exit
returns to this shaft, also, but *on the toyshop level* instead (which
can potentially be rather disorienting to those unfamiliar with this
area). At the bottom of this shaft is a [secret
door](Hidden_Doors "wikilink") leading north into a treasure room (see
[Treasure-Hunting](Treasure-Hunting "wikilink")); this door may be
[bashed](Bash "wikilink") open but may not be passed magically.

## Adventuring

Groups normally [portal](Portal "wikilink") to the [Long
Tapeworm](Long_Tapeworm "wikilink"), which is actually at the very
bottom of the map, then proceed upwards through the area's long vertical
shaft. All players need to be flying, as the shaft consists of airborn
rooms. Note that every single mob here is hidden, so players need
[Detect Hidden](Detect_Hidden "wikilink"),
[Alertness](Alertness "wikilink"),
[Awareness](Awareness_(command/skill) "wikilink"), or [Heighten
Senses](Heighten_Senses "wikilink"). The mobs of interest are the
insects who live alone in rooms adjacent to the shaft on each level.
They carry keys to chests that contain gear.

Other mobs include elves who wander around the map, and the [Long
Tapeworm](Long_Tapeworm "wikilink"). Each of the toy shop rooms contains
an elf who casts mage spells. The tapeworm has a key to a treasure room
to the north of it, however it has sanctuary and uses breath attacks.

All of the mobs in this area scavenge (i.e. pick up mob corpses or items
dropped onto the ground).
