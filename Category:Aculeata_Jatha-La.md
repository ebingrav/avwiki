*The Midgaardian realm is not home simply to sleeping dragons and man
eating squirrels. Places exist within the bowels of the earth that make
even the greatest of wizards and most renowned warriors shake in their
vambraces. Located deep beneath the Haunted Forest, Aculeata Jatha-La is
one such place.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

**Builder:** Ibn

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink"): 16s, 2e, s, 3e, 2s,
2e, 2n, e, s.

Walking route from [Kelsee](Kelsee "wikilink"): s, \[s\], s, e, s, d, e,
d, e, s (safe and northernmost private room)

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested: none.

## Connections

-   [Haunted Forest](:Category:Haunted_Forest.md "wikilink")
    ([map](Haunted_Forest_Map.md "wikilink"))

## Navigation

The area is split into four layers:

-   Within the nest - first half of this layer is mob-free, rest is wasp
    infested,
-   Deep Withing the Nest - second layer is all wasps,
-   Deepest Recesses / Substratum - third layer is even more wasps,
-   Ponderous flowers - Chloroform infested, with groundskeepers.

## Adventuring

The first part of first layer is safe, until you reach the private
rooms, with no mobs in them. To reach the northermost safe room go from
[Kelsee](Kelsee "wikilink"): 3s,e,s,d,e,d,e,s.

Once in the area proper expect a lot of aggressive wasps. The [unholy
and ghastly wasps](Ghastly_Wasp.md "wikilink") are invisible and
demonfired, and are smaller than the [visible](Irate_Wasp.md "wikilink")
ones, but just as agressive. Some of the wasps ([cunning
wasps](Cunning_Wasp.md "wikilink") for example, may be others) - are
stabbers. One did \*ERADICATING\* through full AC and spells on a high
level hero, so expect to die regardless of experience or AC. Best
protection is a large HP pool.

The best experience is deep within the hive, i.e. 4-5 rooms east/south
of the left hand entrance to the mob area, or 2s, all east of the right
hand entrance. Because a CR is very difficult here, you may want to
avoid going solo too far if you're not a big hero or have no alts to do
the CR, as the angels/Immortals will not help with CR efforts in EHA
areas.

For a 12+ large group, the fourth layer may be appealing, which has
chloroforms (good xp) and the groundskeepers -
[Chalmers](Chalmers "wikilink") (corpse eater) and
[Skaggs](Skaggs "wikilink") (janitor - will pick up dispersed gear),
carrying [Barbed Crescent
Talismans](Barbed_Crescent_Talisman "wikilink").

## Comments

This area can provide some of the best hero XP for a large sized group
(20k xp/run is achievable with the right group). You'll want to have at
least 12 group members to do the wasps and more if you plan to take on
the fourth layer (chloroforms and groundskeepers). Mobs are extremely
aggie and you'll need a way to heal damage
(healers/paladins/brandishes). For heroes will small hit points, [hit
point gear](:Category:Hit-Point_Gear.md "wikilink") / [animal
handler](Eragora_-_Animal_Handler.md "wikilink") is recommended. For low
level heroes without enough movement points, either bring [Seven-League
Boots](Seven-League_Boots "wikilink") or [Piece Of Ginseng
Root](Piece_Of_Ginseng_Root "wikilink").

Chloroforms have a strong AOE damage spell so you'll want to have
multiple groupmates trying to bash them.

This is the second elite hero area, added May 2th, 2008.
