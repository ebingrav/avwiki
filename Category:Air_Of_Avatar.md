*There are several air pathways above our fair realm that allows anyone
with the [fly spell](Fly "wikilink") to soar like an eagle between most
of the major cities. These airways are usually accesable from the dead
center of the realm's bigger towns, such as
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink"),
[Mervue](:Category:_Mervue "wikilink"),
[Ofcol](:Category:_Ofcol "wikilink") and
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink").*

**Level Range:** 10-12

**Builder:** Crom

## Directions

Walking route from [Sol](Sol "wikilink"): 3e, 6s, u.

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 9s, 7e, \[e\], 3u.

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Yazimetra](Yazimetra "wikilink").

## Connections

This area connects to [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"),
[Ofcol](:Category:_Ofcol "wikilink"), [Mt.
Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink"),
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink"),
[Mervue](:Category:_Mervue "wikilink"),
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink") and [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink").

## Navigation

This area is fairly uniform throughout, with various mobs wandering in
and out.

The Air of Avatar is probably primarily used as a quick route for those
with flying to get around the mainland area of Midgaardia. It is
particularly useful in getting from the west ([Mt.
Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink") or
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink")) to the east ([the Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") or
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink")), or from the north
([Ofcol](:Category:_Ofcol "wikilink")) to the south
([Mervue](:Category:_Mervue "wikilink")). The connections from Midgaard
are of course useful, the trouble taken to walk from Aelmon to the
walls, climb up onto them and proceed to the towers is often less worth
the effort taken to find a shorter route. For this reason, the Midgaard
connection is best taken if you are looking for an area close to, but
outside of Midgaard, rather than a route to the centre of the city.

## Adventuring

Air of Avatar is a fast, easy transport between
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"),
[Ofcol](:Category:_Ofcol "wikilink"), [Mt.
Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink"), and
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink") by means of the [fly
spell](Fly "wikilink"), [griffon wings
bracer](Griffon_Wings_Bracer "wikilink"), or any other means of
[flying](Flying_Flag "wikilink"). The area hosts several cute flying
mobs. Note that dying here without the [Fly](Fly "wikilink") spell or
the racial ability to fly can make trying to self-CR very difficult.
