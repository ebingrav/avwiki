*The Elemental Plane of Air, or Airscape, is ruled by a twin brother and
sister known collectively as the Windprinces. Benign among the ranks of
Planar Rulers, they are content to be left alone to manage the affairs
of their world, and dote upon their menagerie of mist-creatures.*

*It is said to be notoriously difficult to fight Air Elementals in their
native habitat, where thay can become intangible at will.*
