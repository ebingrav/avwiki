*For centuries, ever since weather magic became common, denizens of
Midgaardia have been meddling with the weather for own purpose. Whether
this has been due to surface travelling drow wishing to protect
themselves from the harsh light of the sun, clerics and mages calling
forth lightning to strike down their enemies, or from those wishing to
bring rain to their crops, the results have been the same. The climate
of Midgaardia has become increasingly erratic and unpredictable. Now,
with the rise of stormlords, weathermancy has been elevated to new
levels and the elements have become even more unpredictable.*

*With all of this going on, it is not surprising that aerial travel
across the skies of Midgaardia is hazardous, if not impossible in many
places. What is perhaps much more surprising is the fact that air travel
is not only possible along certain routes, but both easy and convenient.
Lofty pathways have long existed for the aeronautically inclined linking
many of the major settlements, such as Midgaard, Mervue, Ofcol, Solace
and Mt Durr, as well as a handful of other locations. The reasons for
this are unclear. It has been theorised that there exist magical
ley-lines between these locations which contribute in keeping the skies
clear for travel, while others have postulated that it is the very
travel itself which keeps these particular airways navigable.*

*Recently, new paths have been discovered and old ones changed. Access
to the skies of Midgaardia can now be found from as far west as Qanza
Prairie, to as far east as the Wildwood, to the island of Gorn's Anchor
in the far south. Further, strange lights have recently been seen in the
northeastern skies, and many wonder what this new change signifies.*

## Navigation

The area is a connector area, connecting many interesting and often
visited locations, thus cutting traveling time between those areas. The
area itself is a mesh of fairly linear airways with no obstacles that
connect these points.

## Adventuring

The area is appropriate for lowmorts of this level, with various weaker
elementals and somewhat larger native life such as clouds, birds and
harpies. A very small amount of these mobs are aggressive so travel
should be mostly safe. Combat is not overly difficult and mob
concentration is rather high, making the area good for xp.

One noticeable element is the behavior of the elementals which drift
into and out of rooms very fast, making attacking them a matter of
timing as well as finding them.
