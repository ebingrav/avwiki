*Years of herding catoblepas have hardened Akrikto, who spends most of
his time chasing trespassers off his property. The rest of his time is
spent keeping the catoblepas from escaping -- a failure, to say the
least. Yet even this simple farmer harbors a dark secret. Every day he
is reminded of the mistakes of his past.*

## Connections

## Navigation

The area consists of two distinct parts - the upper layer with the
three-room house and a large field (5x4) to the west, and the lower part
with the network of caves (about 5x3 + a 6-room addition). Navigating
both is mostly trivial.

To get to the lower levels, you need to push the table. It will slam
shut behind you. The area beneath the table has aggie mobs which can hit
very hard compared to their cow neighbors above.

Entire area is uncursed so feel free to recall anytime.

## Adventuring

The area's upper layer is an Eragoran response to [Tortuga
Cay](:Category:Tortuga_Cay "wikilink") (except for the fleeing). The
cows are big, juicy, non-aggie and flee with great regularity, making it
necessary to chase them a lot (or trip, panic, etc). This makes them a
bit tricky (or simply tedious). Two s3 disintegrates will kill them for
over 200xp per cow. The bulls are a bit more HP-heavy but hit just as
weak, and three s3 disintegrates will kill them for over 300xp each.

There is an invis [poacher](poacher "wikilink") in the farm, which
carries the [Catoblepas Leather
Pouch](Catoblepas_Leather_Pouch "wikilink").

Only the tree may prove to be an issue to smaller casters.

As for the lower areas, they are a bit more dangerous due to multiple
aggie mobs (that also hit harder) per room. So duo these if you lack the
HPs to solo.

Area is not really big enough to sustain a prolonged run with a
brute-oriented group; however, neither is it so demanding as to require
one.

You might want to beware of corpse eaters, at least one of the Heifers
eats mob corpses, but the centipedes and other nasty creatures in the
cave systems eat player corpses.

Unlike some other Eragoran areas, this area will not auto-CR you. Due to
no rooms being cursed, mercy and gurney will work just fine.
