*Rumors have come out of the Wildwood of a dragon worshiping cult taking
root in the mountains northeast of Kreigstadt. This cult is supposedly a
twisted version of the Golden Citadel in Ofcol. The members guard and
protect a bronze wyrm in exchange for the healing properties of his
blood. It is said they use this blood to maintain the life of a
multi-headed abomination of dragonkind.*

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 16e, \[e\], 2e, n, 2e,
3s, 3e, 3n, 2w, 3n, w, n, e, n, e, 3n, 2e, 2s, 3e, 2s, 2e, 3s, 3e, n,

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Seer](Dragon_Seer "wikilink") (wanders) and [Golden
Hydra](Golden_Hydra "wikilink"). Both [aggie](Aggressive "wikilink") and
tail.

## Connections

A list of [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") connected to Ancient
Bronze Wyrm:

-   [Wildwood](:Category:Wildwood "wikilink").
-   [Midgaard](:Category:Midgaard "wikilink").

## Navigation

This area is really two parts. The first part is the general area with
[seer](Dragon_Seer "wikilink"), [Golden Hydra](Golden_Hydra "wikilink"),
and [The Bronze Dragon, Kastinius](Kastinius "wikilink"). All here tail
and are really nasty. Once you defeat Kastinius pull the lever that
appears and enter the second part. Not as nasty here with non-aggie
librarians. There are a few aggie here ([Alayna](Alayna "wikilink")) and
it is as small as the previous area. Look for some nice history books
here.

## Adventuring

Small area (30 rooms) with some high level dragons that tail a lot.
Small group will do ok with some nice xp. The bronze dragon is the
hardest here.
