The Angels are a class of individuals who have chosen to sacrifice all
mortal possessions and their former ways of life, and have dedicated
themselves to helping their fellow players. Angels try to remain
accessible and friendly to mortals, and will help when they can, but
please remember that they are not your personal slaves, and they do have
the whole mud to watch over. Angel aid also differs from the direct
material aid often associated with the hero class. Angels have given up
fighting and getting equipment; instead they try to help with advice and
guidance, as well as with CRs and emergency situations. Thus, the role
of the Angel class is that of a teacher/mentor to the mud, using
personal experience with the game to help guide fellow players to become
better mudders.

The Angels assist the Immortals in making Avatar a good place to play.
Angels cannot prevent mortals from encountering affliction and danger,
but they can and will help mortals learn to cope with such occurrences.
Angels stand ready to welcome strangers to our realm and to assist even
the smallest of Avatar's citizens.

Angels abide by the code of their kind. While they will offer quick help
in true emergencies, the best assistance they offer is that of teaching
and mentoring. Angels have a special place in their hearts for mortals
who are willing to learn the ways of Avatar and work at solving their
own problems.
