*The Antharian Arena, where nobody knows your name, and nobody wants to.
That is, unless you win. Victory brings fame and fortune, or, as often
happens, sudden and gruesome death. Only the most bravest and stupid
heroes enter the Antharian Arena. Only the lucky leave it.*

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested: none.

## Connections

-   [Sanctum](Sanctum "wikilink")

## Navigation

The layout is a linear path that traces a square with four champion
bosses at the corners, and a one way exit from the end to the start
(with a few hidden rooms along the way).

## Adventuring

There are several Champion (tough) mobs behind locked doors, and
possibly others off the beaten path. Combined, the bosses load over 100k
in gems. One of the Champion rooms is nospell. The Champions appear to
be progessively more difficult.

Many mobs in the area use special abilities such as psi spells and
toss/disarm. The gladiators spawn "ghosts" on death who will usually
aggie whomever killed them. These drop soul shards that appear to be
quest items of some kind ("trash"). There is a hidden latrine with a
locked down exit.

The demon Logomoth carries a spiritlinked throwing weapon called "a
demonic blood beetle".
