*Far, far from [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"), in the very
northeastern reaches of the Great Forest
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink"), the forces of Apocalypse and
his Horsemen, Death, War, Famine and Pestilence are bringing this corner
of the worlds to its knees. This is a place of fire, of widespread
[plague](Plague "wikilink"), of starvation and misery. Going there is
said to bring nothing but sickness, tragedy and death. The few who
claimed to have survived a trip to Apocalypse are generally shunned in
the cities, dismissed as madmen or feared as demons.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

## Adventuring

lots of pps. skel guar is a nice safe one. Plenty of non aggie mobs, but
this area has a reputation for a reason...

Many mobs will aggy on visible characters, so movehidden is recommended.
Lowmort groups should stick to the ground level and scan before moving
so as not to accidently wander into a horsie or [Dust
Demon](Dust_Demon "wikilink"). Heroes duoing or small lowhero groups
will do well here, also can dive into survivor section and go after
[Jackal](Jackal "wikilink") for
[Carbs](Carburized_Steel_Plate_Armor "wikilink")
([Panther](Panther "wikilink") also carries the armor but he is
significantly more difficult).

## Exploring the area

The main attractions of this area are the five Horsemen - War, Famine,
Pestilence, Death, and Apocalypse. Due to their size and strength, and
the low xp & modest gear they provide, they are virtually never killed.
In order of difficulty (lowest to highest), they are: Pestilence, Death,
War, Famine, Apocalypse (who is sanced and 8 levels higher). It takes
approximately 15-17 torments surged at 5 to kill these mobs (and
presumably 5-10 more for their boss).
