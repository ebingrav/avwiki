*Arcadia is the home plane of the True Fae.*

*At one time, they called Midgaardia their home, and some say they are
the ancestors of our elves and drow and sprites, and, the Fae would
claim, of all True Magic.*

*But Midgaardia grew too ugly for their tastes, the ascendence of vulgar
humanity was too much for them, and according to some, the constant war
with the ancestors of modern Drow was the straw that broke the camel's
back.*

*The High King, Adrial, created a new plane of reality of pure magic,
and exiled himself and his Fae there. Those who were left behind
gradually forgot Arcadia, and their King. The most powerful of their
descendants hold but a glimmer of the magical might of the True Fae.*
