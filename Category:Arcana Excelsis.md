*Somewhere, in a pocket dimension all of its own, is the tower Arcana
Excelsis. Originally, it was built to house the Arcane Conclave, a body
of mages, sorcerers, stormlords and wizards who gather to regulate and
oversee the use of magic throughout the realm. Since then it has grown
into a repository for magical lore and a place of learning.*

*While it is located away from the normal lands of Midgaard and access
is said to be invite only, rumours speak of glimpses of a shining tower
near a great tree.*

**Level Range:** 37-42
