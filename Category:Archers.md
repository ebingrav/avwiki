*"Any fool can fling arrows off a parapet at an attacking army, but to
truly master the bow requires a lifetime of dedication."  
*     -Vercing Sableroix, Bowmaker to Royalty

*ARCHERS are skilled hunters and scouts, as well as being masters with
their chosen weapon, the [bow](:Category:_Bows.md "wikilink"). Their
[skills](:Category:_Archer_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") represent
their ability to survive in the wild, track down their foes, and their
self-sufficiency in building and repairing the tools of their trade.
Achieving real skill in archery takes such a lengthy commitment that
master archers are generally reluctant to teach those who have already
started down a different path.*

*Tall, agile [races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") with good eyesight
make the best archers, notably [ELVES](Elves.md "wikilink") and
[CENTAURs](Centaurs.md "wikilink"). Clumsy, bulky or non-humanoid races
such as [OGREs](Ogres.md "wikilink") and
[GRIFFONs](Griffons.md "wikilink") will not fare so well. The [PRIME
REQUISITE](Prime_Requisite.md "wikilink") of archers is
[DEXterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink").*

**Abbreviation:** Arc.

**[Prime Requisite](Prime_Requisite.md "wikilink"):**
[Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink").

## Archers in General

Archers can be generally described as hard hitting
[sponges](Sponge.md "wikilink"). This is because archers do most damage
when using long bows - weapons which only operate properly if the archer
is not tanking the mobs but instead remaining at the back, out of harm's
way. Because of this, most archers live a relaxed life of being warmly
accepted, grouped, tanked and enjoying huge damage they dish out.

To elaborate on this point a bit further - during a standard
lowmort/hero run, archer damage far outweighs other beneficial actions
an archer may perform, like rescuing groupies, brandishing a staff, or
doing some other activity. Thus, the leaders prefer to "leave them be",
and require little of the archers save to perhaps choose a proper set of
[ammunition](:Category:Ammunition.md "wikilink") for a particular area.

However. Archers make for quite capable soloers, have a plethora of
utility abilities, and are quite proficient tanks, should the player
wish to play them like that. Read on for details.

Archer statistics are somewhat comparable to (small) warriors - they
recieve low mana but have plenty of HP.

## Archer Creation

[Race](:Category:Races.md "wikilink") is very important for an archer.
The most common choices are [elf](elf "wikilink"),
[orc](orc "wikilink"), [centaur](centaur "wikilink"),
[drow](drow "wikilink"), and [lizard man](Lizard_Man.md "wikilink").
Large or "clawed" races (with the exception of harpies) have a penalty
at archery. See the [Racial Archery
Modifier](Racial_Archery_Modifier "wikilink") for more information.

## Archers at Lowmort Tier

### Weapons

Once you have created a new archer - the choice which weapon to use is
up to you. Some archers prefer to use regular swords for the first 10-15
levels, while others stick to the crossbow from start.

What is important to memorize is that there are several weapons archers
can use:

-   Long Bows - these deal most damage, but are unusable in direct
    melee. Use them only if being tanked.
-   Short Bows - these do less damage, but have less of a penalty for
    melee. Generally, archers do not use them at all.
-   Heavy Crossbows - these do high damage, but are moderately difficult
    to use in melee and also carry reload penalties. Generally they are
    not used at all, either.
-   Light Crossbows - thse do low damage but carry no penalty for melee
    use. These are used when soloing or tanking.

The exotic weapon categories like blowguns, guns (arbalests), compound
bows or slings are never used by archers due to lackluster performance
in both melee and out of it.

The exception are the slings which are exclusively used by
[Fusiliers](:Category:Fusiliers.md "wikilink") - the only prestige class
archers are eligible for.

### HR and Ammunition

Unlike all other classes that rely on [Damage
Roll](Damage_Roll "wikilink") to define the strength of their attacks,
archers function differently and use the [Hit
Roll](Hit_Roll "wikilink"). The higher their HR, the more damaging the
attack.

Also, unlike all other classes that attack several times a round,
archers usually fire a single arrow per round.

However, the [ammo](:Category:Ammunition.md "wikilink") gets used up, so
be mindful of your ammo status and replenish it well in advance. An
archer with no ammo does no damage.

### Training

Similar to most classes, train wisdom first, then constitution and
intelligence. Strength should be increased next since every point of
strength also benefits the archer's HR, and dexterity generally does
nothing save boost the [Armor Class](Armor_Class "wikilink").

### Practicing

Key skills that make using bows more effective are:

-   [Fletch](Fletch "wikilink") (level 9), which allows one to make an
    ample supply of ammunition,
-   various ammunition skills, allowing fletching of better types of
    ammo,
-   [Target Leading](Target_Leading "wikilink") (level 15) and [Improved
    Aim](Improved_Aim "wikilink") (level 31), which greatly improve
    accuracy with bows (and thus damage),
-   [Dodge](Dodge "wikilink") helps with soloing.

The rest are utility skills which can be deferred till later if needed.

### Worshipping

Most archers worship [Roixa](Roixa "wikilink"). Those in a hurry to
remort sometimes worship [Werredan](Werredan "wikilink") because of the
XP boost. [Durr](Durr "wikilink") is also occasionally worshiped for the
large fletching boost it provides.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** If using a missile weapon, you must use a [light
crossbow](:Category:Light_Crossbows.md "wikilink") or
[gun](:Category:Guns.md "wikilink") for either soloing or tanking. Other
missile weapons (bows specifically) suffer a penalty when the user is
being attacked, resulting in a large number of missed shots.

As far as gear is concerned, remember to wear HR improving gear to
maximize your damage.

**Tanking:** Identical to soloing. However, if grouped, hitting is far
more effective.

**Hitting:** Long bows are used when hitting in a group, since they
typically have more HR and ordinarily do much more damage.

**Healing:** Archers cannot heal at lowmort tier.

## Archer Prestige Options

Archers can [prestige](:Category:Prestige_Classes.md "wikilink") to
[fusiliers](:Category:_Fusiliers.md "wikilink") or
[soldiers](:Category:_Soldiers.md "wikilink") at lvl 50. Fusiliers are
specialized archer-types who use slings and excel at
[Scattershot](Scattershot "wikilink") and [Dodge](Dodge "wikilink").

## Archers at Hero Tier

It is rare to see an archer doing anything except hitting at hero tier.
Most group leaders will always welcome an archer in the fold.

Aside for damage output, archers at hero tier can cast
[Barkskin](Barkskin "wikilink") on others, which is a relatively rare
spell. They also can utilize their [Tracking](Track "wikilink")
proficiencies, as well as [Skin](Skin "wikilink") corpses for special
items, and thus help with farming gear.

### Scattershot vs. Held Shot

Using scattershot at hero tier is possible if not tanking - otherwise
the amount of scatterable projectiles is reduced and generally not worth
the effort. When scattershoting a portion of arrows will hit, and
generally speaking, they will deal more combined damage than a single
projectile. To be able to see all projectiles remember to have CONFIG
+BATTLESELF configured.

However, scattershoting eats ammunition at a high rate (often 5x faster)
so one needs to have enough to last over a run.

Held shot spares ammunition and deals multiplied damage every other
round, but few mobs are big enough to survive that long during regular
hero runs. Thus, it is more used at lord tier.

Also, unlike scattershot, held shots will be interrupted if the archer
receives any damage mid-round (from spells, smashes, etc), and will put
the archer in a huge lag.

### Ammunition

<B>Note:</B> An update in mid-2022 has made it so that an archer can
only hold an ammo type that they know how to
[fletch](Fletch.md "wikilink"). This means they cannot use piercing
arrows/bolts/bullets until hero level 99 and splinter until hero 101.
They can however make 'heroic' versions of lowmort arrows/bolts, barbed
and steel.

Archers usually either use piercing or splinter arrows. Splinter arrows
do more damage (about one \* difference) against unarmored mobs but are
useless against mobs with armor ('with armor' means with any items
equipped other than weapons). Since the difference is not that large,
some people just prefer to use piercing arrows against all mobs and save
themselves the hassle of changing ammunition. You fletch splinter arrows
at twice the rate of piercing arrows. However splinter arrows are
destroyed on use whereas piercing arrows can often be recovered after a
fight.

Explosive arrows are incredibly difficult to fletch, only do about one
\* above splinters, but damage armored enemies. When you fletch enough
explosive arrows, you will enter a hidden exhaust during which time you
won't be able to make any more of them. To stockpile explosive arrows,
fletch 3 to 4 batches of explosives (or until you fail to produce
anything twice in a row), each time you fletch would normally. Assuming
you fletch arrows after every run or every other run, that will be
enough time to let the exhaustion wear off. Generally no one uses this
type of ammo except for the [Ultimate
Dragon](Ultimate_Dragon "wikilink") battle.

[Sableroix arrows](Sableroix_Arrows.md "wikilink") were recently added
for hero 200+ archers.

### Training

Increase your gain-generating stats first: wisdom, constitution,
intelligence (in that order). Strength comes next for a Hr boost, and
lastly dexterity. Train those two only when you have enough practices to
spare.

### Practicing

Of hero abilities notable are:

-   [Enhanced Aim](Enhanced_Aim "wikilink") - final accuracy/damage
    boosting skill, very important.
-   [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"), [Frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink"), Cure
    blindness/poison/disease, [Fly](Fly "wikilink"), [Water
    Breathing](Water_Breathing "wikilink") - archers are idle most of
    the runs, so leaders sometimes expect them to help others who cannot
    cast these themselves.
-   [Barkskin](Barkskin "wikilink") - when no other alternatives are
    around, archers can help spell up others.
-   [Longshot](Longshot "wikilink") - this is an ability often mapped to
    a trigger so the group leader may order the archer to immediately
    longshot mobs in adjacent rooms. The concept is simple - draw one
    enemy at a time towards the group instead of rushing a group in a
    highly-populated aggressive room.
-   [Scattershot](Scattershot "wikilink") - Rarely used at hero tier due
    to the quickness of individual battles.

### Devoting

Archers usually devote to whoever they're worshiping.

**Excerpt from the [Devotion](Devotion "wikilink") Effects Table**

\|}

-   Durr: Those worshiping Durr do it for the fletching bonus. This may
    or may not be affected by intelligence or dexterity. Losing strength
    means one less HR, and losing constitution means less HP at
    level-ups.

<!-- -->

-   Werredan: Devotion means even less mana and less AC, for more damage
    (1 more STR translates to HR) and more HP on level-ups. The downside
    of devoting is marginal.

<!-- -->

-   Roixa: Lower HR (by a single point) and lower mana gains are
    exchanged for more AC, more HP gains and (potentially) more
    practices. Since archers rarely use mana, this is generally
    acceptable.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Soloing is hard until you can get enough HP to cover the
hits you will take. Using appropriate mix of hit and AC gear is
important - see [Tanking In Hit Gear](Tanking_In_Hit_Gear "wikilink")
for more information. A light crossbow is essential. Also, try and find
areas with bow-wielding mobs; [arrow dodge](Arrow_Dodge.md "wikilink")
is a very useful skill.

**Tanking:** Arcs can certainly tank, and can even do well - but you'll
need excellent AC and a good [light
crossbow](:Category:Light_Crossbows.md "wikilink") (unless you want to
tank with wield/shield - which probably won't be worth it). If larger
you can tank in mixed or full-HR gear, or optionally simply pack a
healer.

**Hitting:** Archers are the best hitters after 101 overall. After
defeating the [Ultimate Dragon](Ultimate_Dragon "wikilink"), they hit
even harder. A centaur in proper gear and wearing [Ultimate
Dragon](Ultimate_Dragon "wikilink") gear can easily average a \*MANGLE
during the course of a run, and several other races with [Racial Archery
Modifier](Racial_Archery_Modifier "wikilink") bonus can approach this
closely.

**Healing:** While archer certainly *can* brandish, it requires removing
arrows from held slot and for that time the archer cannot shoot. Thus
nobody does that since archer damage is generally too precious. Archers
do get access to [Heal](Heal "wikilink") to be used in emergencies.

## Archers at Lord Tier

Normally, regular archer damage is low even in T1 gear - however, see
the comments on scattershot below It is near the bottom, beating out
only Fus and War/Bod. Therefore archers are not as popular in lord
groups like they are in hero groups, and are usually required (beckoned)
only if there is something that requires skinning on the run.

Archers at lord tier use in either ice arrows or lightning arrows
(mithril arrows do junk damage), but fletching these does cost mana -
which means fletching is a grueling affair requiring a lot of sleep and
time. Ice arrows (and stones) do very little damage against armored
foes, so lightning arrows (or stones) are recommended for mobs with
significant armor.

An archer who uses longshot can make a major positive contribution to a
group by forcing mobs to change rooms; strategic use of longshot can
help a group lure away one mob at a time from a large room. This can
prolong the group's overall hp.

When running, archers can choose to either held or scatter their shots,
held does less overall damage and is prone to (frequent) interruptions,
but it saves the ammo, whereas scatter does more damage due to increased
scattershot limits (can fire 7 arrows if not tanking), but this can
consume huge amounts of ammo (1-3 thousand arrows a run).

Occasionally on gear runs an archer might be placed near the end of a
tank chain and to quote someone else, "there is absolutely nothing wrong
with an arc being in tank chain, even naked, or wearing all Arcgear.
Buying the casters more time to kill the mobs is a GOOD thing". An
archer at lord might be asked to cast spells on group members, usually
sanctuary for those without it or regeneration on tanks. Occasionally an
archer may even be asked to bash for the group. Archers are needed for a
couple of runs for skinning. Due to the death exp penalty Rxa can be a
very bad choice of worship at lord as lord exp is harder to come by
therefore a lot of archers worship Wer or Dur at lord.

In general hero is relatively easy for an archer and there is a big
chance to sponge, at lord this is harder to do and usually frowned upon
by your fellow group members. AFK archers have been known to be
ungrouped in dangerous places.

### Using scattershot

Archers can do a fair amount of damage using scattershot, especially if
the mob is bashed - comparable to a caster. The best way to do this is
to first initiate combat normally (either with the *kill* command or
wait to be drawn into combat after the tank) and then scatter 7 every
round (initiating combat with scattershot will put you in lag, 1 sec for
each arrow you use in scattershot). To see the damage from each shot,
you need to *config +battleself*. Note that scattershot uses up
ammunition extremely fast, so you need to have fletched a lot of them in
advance. Together with the mana requirement for fletching at lord, this
can be a tedious affair, requiring lot of regenning. The best way to do
this is via a script in your mud client. You can keep the arrows (braces
of 500 each) in a locker (if you can find one available).

## Archer Remort Options

Archers can remort into [assassins](:Category:Assassins.md "wikilink").

Remort races that benefit archery are [High
Elves](High_Elves "wikilink") (terrific archers akin to centaurs), and
[Tuataurs](Tuataurs "wikilink") (very good archers). Archers also remort
to [Sprites](Sprites "wikilink") or [Demonseeds](Demonseeds "wikilink")
after defeating the [Ultimate Dragon](Ultimate_Dragon "wikilink") in
order to create powerful fusiliers that carry the [Ultimate Archer's
Gauntlet](Ultimate_Archer's_Gauntlet "wikilink") - which is otherwise
unavailable to fusiliers.
