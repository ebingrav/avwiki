## How to get there

To walk here from Midgaardia:

1.  Withdraw a [ruby](:Category:Gemstones "wikilink") from the bank (the
    [Ent Banker](Banker "wikilink") in
    [Mervue](:Category:Mervue "wikilink") as a good starting point for
    this journey).
2.  Go a little south to the docks, where Charon the Ferryman will ferry
    you and your group to Eragora if you give him a ruby.
3.  On arrival, head east from the docks and through the [Sphynx
    Gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate "wikilink") (you will need to be
    visible, and enter one at a time).
4.  Travel east through the [Rhuien
    Jungle](:Category:Rhuien_Forest "wikilink"), while pausing to admire
    or fight off some of the interesting local flora.
5.  Continue travelling east through the [Eragora
    Walkways](:Category:Eragora_Walkways "wikilink"), a series of paths
    through the plains and patches of jungle.
6.  After taking a quick rest at the
    [campfire](Eragora_Default_Recall "wikilink") in Eragora Walkways,
    the entrance to the settlement is a little to the south east.

<spoiler text='Portal directions:'>Walking route from [Eragora default
recall](Eragora_default_recall "wikilink"): 1 south, 1 east, 1 north, 2
east.

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested: None, though it is
very easy to get to.</spoiler>

  
Please note:

-   On your return journey, Charon's brother, Kharon, will be waiting to
    transport you.
-   Just *say Mervue* to Kharon, and he will ferry you to dockside at
    Mervue, for free.
-   The southern continent of Eragora cannot be travelled to by
    teleportation, portal, or nexus spell.
-   You cannot access sanctum in Eragora, so make sure you are properly
    equipped before you travel there.

## Exploring the area

This area has been written especially for those players who like
exploring new, uncharted territory, alone or with friends, and at their
own speed.

The fact that players must explore and uncover the secrets of this area
themselves without the availability of online information largely
justifies the hidden rewards that await them. A lot of effort has been
put into the room descriptions to help you find your way around.

I hope you enjoy exploring it, looking at stuff (and you can look at
pretty much everything), doing the quests, and so on.

## Services

Among various services and shops, you can find a store room where you
can access your [lockers](lockers "wikilink") and a
[bank](bank "wikilink").

## In the event of death

While the local residents enjoy the attentive ministrations of the local
priest upon dying, foreign invaders like yourselves are normally tossed
into the River Etuan from the walls, where the local angel fish eagerly
await corpses.

## Quests

This area has a range of quests from small and easy to large and
complicated for explorers to discover.

One quest in particular should probably be mentioned though:

The [Dark Acolyte Quest](Demonic_Intent_Quest "wikilink") is a
hero-level quest whose reward is permanent. Although, if you rebirth you
will lose the skill it grants.
