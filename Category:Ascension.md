*Deep in the dark recesses of Tarterus, a new evil grows. Practicing
dark rites, Tialoc, an ancient mystic of unknown origin, is building an
army in hopes of one day challenging Anthraxus for total domination of
the lower planes. Tialoc's power comes from the souls of fallen
adventureres..directly by consuming them and trapping them in limbo
forever. His stronghold is a collection of three bizarre towers that
have sprung up in the heart of Tarterus, daring any to enter their dark
confines. Great treasure is there, as well as the greatest of risks.*

**Builder:** Yevaud

## Directions

From [Tarterus](:Category:Tarterus "wikilink") shift, go w, 2u, 2n

## Connections

Only connects to [Tarterus Proper](:Category:Tarterus_Proper "wikilink")
as mentioned above.

## Navigation

This area is composed of three towers: one to the east, one to the west,
and one to the north. You need a key to access the Twisted Tower to the
north.

## Adventuring

This area is incredibly swarmy and unpredictable, but it can yield some
great exp for a group of 20 if you manage to survive. I'm pretty sure
the mobs in all three towers drift, so I wouldn't try to sleep anywhere
in this area other than the courtyard.

The first room of the tower to the west is nospell.

This area is home to the [Ring Of Higher
Power](Ring_Of_Higher_Power "wikilink") run. See [Gear In
Ascension](:Category:Gear_In_Ascension "wikilink") for more information.
