*The woods are hidden away on [the eastern
trail](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") that wraps around the
northern edge of [Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink"), near
[Brothers' Grimm](:Category:_Brothers_Grimm "wikilink"). Rumored to be
the domain of bloodthirsty [hobgoblins](Hobgoblins "wikilink"), not many
adventurers have gone to actually check it out. Reports from yeomen and
patrolling knights indicate the mass influx of
[goblins](Goblins "wikilink") entering the area, although none have
returned, and have possibly been killed by the
[hobgoblins](Hobgoblins "wikilink"). Evidence for this, one green knight
says, is the low guttural cries that are heard constantly, sometimes
scattering the doves in front of Grimms' cottage.*

## Connections

This area connects to [Brothers
Grimm](:Category:_Brothers_Grimm "wikilink").

## Navigation

The western part of the area has nice clumps of stationary mobs that are
good for exp, though some of the hobgoblins are
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), and the goblins in the room
may [assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink"). The eastern section, as
discussed in the Adventuring section, has some tougher mobs.

## Adventuring

This area can provide a decent amount of exp. A good number of the
hobgoblins are [aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), so try to
target them if there are multiple mobs in the room. The [Griffon Wings
Bracer](Griffon_Wings_Bracer "wikilink") in this area is highly useful,
as it grants [Fly](Fly "wikilink").

From the author:  
The mob levels increase based on how far into the area you get. The mobs
near the entrance are 11-12. The training area (after you go through the
water east/southish, take the west past the living tree) is full of
13-14 level mobs. The tree in the SE corner has the 15-16 mobs.
