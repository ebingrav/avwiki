*Before the Gods came to be and drew together reality as it exists there
were only the raw, unfettered aspects of existence. While often in
apparent opposition to one another these traits of existence have no
direct will or sentience of their own however their presence manifests
in the smallest deeds of the most insignificant creatures right through
to the schemes and desires of the Gods.*

*Indeed, the Gods even fashioned the Objects of Power which each
encapsulate one of the aspects. In conjunction with one another the
aspects encompass global outlooks, interaction and personal behavior and
approaches.*
