*Cold-blooded killers of the most ruthless kind, assassins are lethal
either with a [bow](:Category:_Bows "wikilink") and
[arrow](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink"), or a simple dagger. Calculating
and cerebral by nature, they are known to use a wide variety of methods
to murder their victims.*

*Assassins learn many of the same
[skills](:Category:_Rogue_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") as the
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") class, but generally don't stoop
to [stealing](Steal "wikilink"), picking pockets, or other basic
thuggery. They also have the ability to use
[bows](:Category:_Bows "wikilink"), and learn many
[archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink")
[skills](:Category:_Archer_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink"), but never
those pertaining to hunting or survivalism. Assassins combine these
other classes' skills into one wholly unique and lethal package.*

*To illustrate their calculating nature, assassins have a [Prime
statistic](Prime_Requisite "wikilink") of
[Intelligence](Intelligence "wikilink").*

**Abbreviation:** Asn.

**[Prime Requisite](Prime_Requisite "wikilink"):**
[Intelligence](Intelligence "wikilink").

## Assassins in General

Assassins have the damage skills of both [rogue](rogue "wikilink") and
[archer](:Category:Archers "wikilink") with some new skills mixed in,
but they lose some of the utility skills of both as well (such as:
rescue, portal, exploding arrow and picklock). They also get less
hitpoints than both their parent classes, but get more mana. They have
more INT and less DEX than archers or rogues since Intelligence is their
[prime attribute](Prime_Requisite "wikilink"). Assassins can run like a
rogue (stabber) or like an archer. Assassins need to stab with a
poisoned piercing weapon to have a chance at [insightful
strike](Insightful_Strike "wikilink"), which will raise their
[reputation](Reputation "wikilink"). Because of this an assassin who is
concerned about reputation will want to collect a lot of
[poisons](:Category:poisons "wikilink") for their primary weapon. In
January 2014 [ a quest was added](Assassin_Contracts "wikilink") where
Assassins can take on "contracts" once a day, the reward for which is
one point of reputation.

Assassins don't get [refresh](refresh "wikilink") or
[invigorate](invigorate "wikilink") and can run low on moves easily
using [alertness](alertness "wikilink"). So carrying something like the
[mushrooms](Handfull_Of_Mushrooms "wikilink") (which give endurance as
well as rejuvenate) found in [Pariah's
Paradise](:Category:Pariah's_Paradise "wikilink") or [cotton
candy](Cotton_Candy "wikilink") found in [Carnival](Carnival "wikilink")
is wise. Also, once available, the spell
[Endurance](Endurance "wikilink") can help.

## Assassin Creation

Assassins are a [remort class](:Category:_Remort_Classes "wikilink")
available only to [lord](:Category:Lord "wikilink")
[archers](:Category:_Archers "wikilink"),
[rogues](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") and
[shadowfists](:Category:_Shadowfists "wikilink"). Ideally a race that
has a positive mod to [stealth](Racial_Stealth_Modifier "wikilink") and,
if playing at all as an archer,
[archery](Racial_Archery_Modifier "wikilink"). If planning to run lord a
race that has a [melee damage mod](Racial_Damage_Modifier "wikilink") as
at lord most assassins stab.

## Assassins at Lowmort Tier

### Training

The same as most classes train wis, con, int then dex or str.

### Practicing

Practice most of the skills as you get them. If going the archer route
you can [Sneak Attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink") using a bow for decent
damage. [Insightful Strike](Insightful_Strike "wikilink") is a must as
this allows you a chance to insta kill mobs with
[Murder](Murder "wikilink"), [Backstab](Backstab "wikilink") and the
like when wielding [poisoned piercing
weapons](:Category:poisons "wikilink"), and is also the only way of
raising your [Reputation](Reputation "wikilink") level.

### Worshipping

If your going to be a rogue like assassin - Tor. (Tor nerfs archer
damage)  
If your going to be a archer like assassin - Roixa/Werre. (both nerf
stab damage)  
If you want to be balanced between the two assassin styles - Durr or
Atheist.  
Also, remember that worship affects crafting skills such as [ poison
weapon](Poison_Weapon "wikilink") and [fletch](fletch "wikilink").

### Fighting

**Soloing:**

This can be done like an [Archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") or a
[Rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink"). Using a crossbow with archer gear
using [Sneak Attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink") can be an effective way to
solo the early levels due to the damage done with sneak attack and a
crossbow. When the Assassin has learnt [Lethal
Aim](Lethal_Aim "wikilink") at level 30 starting a fight with [Vital
Shot](Vital_Shot "wikilink") targeting the mobs eye with a piercing
weapon and then swapping to a crossbow can also be effective.

**Tanking:**

Usually done in tank gear using piercing weapons for [Sneak
Attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink") or [Vital Shot](Vital_Shot "wikilink")
at level 30 learn [Lethal Aim](Lethal_Aim "wikilink") and start fights
with [Vital Shot](Vital_Shot "wikilink") targeting the mobs eye.

**Hitting:**

Best done in Archer gear using a longbow, but can easily be done using
Hit gear.

## Assassin Prestige Options

None.

## Assassins at Hero Tier

### Training

The same as Lowmort.

### Practicing

### Devoting

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Usually done in full hit gear (dr) in stabber mode. Fights
can be started with 'vital shot eye' if the assassin has low hp or the
mob is quite large. Once of sufficient size however
[backstab](backstab "wikilink") should do enough to make most mobs go
down fairly quickly. And, as long as the primary weapon is poisoned,
backstab will give a (small) chance for an [instant
kill](Insightful_Strike "wikilink").

**Tanking:** Once of sufficient size this can be done the same as
soloing, i.e, in hit gear (dr) and opening with backstab. With one or
two decent hitters in the group most mobs should go down very fast. It's
worth noting that assassins do not get rescue or portal so a groupie
needs to handle those tasks. Assassins do get [arrow
dodge](Arrow_Dodge "wikilink"), which is nice when facing mobs that
wield ranged weapons.

**Hitting:** Assassins can do some of the best hitting at hero, having
the consistently high damage of an archer combined with the damage bonus
of sneak attack. If, as usual, done as an
[Archer](:Category:Archers "wikilink"), you should try to use [Sneak
Attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink") with your kill trigger. You can set a
secondary trigger to just do a kill if the sneak fails. [Aimed
Shot](Aimed_Shot "wikilink") also is nice, better than held shot. Aimed
is kind of like vital for bows, but it does more than vital with
piercers. Once [snipe](Snipe "wikilink") is learned
[longshots](Longshot "wikilink") will also be better.

## Assassins at Lord Tier

Most assassins stab at lord. Some switch between dr gear for initial
stab and archer gear for the rest of the fight. Having a bow and ammo is
handy for long shotting mobs into rooms, you might want to conserve
poisons on your weapons and prefer to use a bow after the initial stab
as archer damage with aimed shot in lord hitgear is not far off the
damage done with weapons.

At lord 100 the assassin can learn [Slip](Slip "wikilink") but does not
learn [Disengage](Disengage "wikilink"), therefore
[Slip](Slip "wikilink") has to be used in a couple of different ways.

-   If not the only stabber the assassin can rest before a group enters
    a room with a mob in so the assassin can slip into the room to stab.
-   When the group is fighting multiple mobs, when a mob dies the
    assassin maybe able to walk out of the room to slip back in for the
    stab. This depends on the area as in maze areas walking out of a
    room doesn't necessarily mean you can walk back in.
-   If there is a [Priest](:Category:Priests "wikilink") in the group
    the assassin could arrange for the priest to cast
    [Innocence](Innocence "wikilink") on them so they can walk out of
    the room to slip back in, again be careful of maze areas.

Regarding archery, Assassins do not get scattershot, instead they have
aimed shot, which does a bit more damage than normal. However, this
damage is pretty mediocre. It can be used like vs eye to blind mobs and
significantly reduce damage done, though.

Like any lord with Quickstrike, Assassins can use
[Quickstrike](Quickstrike "wikilink") and [Vital
Shot](Vital_Shot "wikilink") mid-round at lord level to target eyes and
blind (those mobs that have eyes anyway).

## Assassin Remort Options

Several [remort races](:Category:Remort_Races "wikilink") are good for
Assassins (pretty much the same that are good for Rogues).

-   Demonseed - arc bonus, very good stealth, small dmg mod
-   Griffon - decent dmg mod, negative arc mod
-   High Elf - good stealth, very good arc mod
-   Minotaur - terrible stealth but very good dmg mod, negative arc mod
-   Troll - bad stealth, decent dmg mod, racial revive
-   Tuatar - very good stealth and arc mods
-   Imp - at lord, very good dmg mod and pretty good stealth
