*The Astral Plane is a place of free roaming nightmares and visions. It
is the nexus point of all psionic magic, and as such, it is almost
overrun by Githyanki seeking to use its power against the Githzerai. The
Githyanki's lich queen has built a small stronghold on the outskirts of
the plane.*

*Recently, the Fae of Arcadia have torn the Astral Realm from Midgaardia
and made it once again, a free-standing plane. They have mounted a huge
invasion to drive the Githyanki out.*
