*In the arena, players may attack and hurt each other in a limited form
of pk. Also, no [death](Death "wikilink") takes place - the loser is
'defeated' rather than killed, and so does not have to [retrieve a
corpse](Corpse_Retrieval "wikilink") and does not lose the normal
[experience points](Experience_Points "wikilink") for dying. Please be
aware that some [spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") still have
negative abilities which can be harmful to
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink").*

**Level Range:** all

**Builder:** Crom
