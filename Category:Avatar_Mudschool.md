*The Mudschool is designed for the TRUE newbie. It is a gentle,
self-paced instructional unit that provides information in little
chunks, and immediate practice of each new
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"). It is NOT a complete
explanation of every single topic of interest. That information will be
in the Tree of Knowledge.*

*At the creation of a new [character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink")
the player will be asked: "Are you an experienced MUDder?"*

*If you say "yes" you will be automatically boosted and promoted to
[Level](Level "wikilink") 2, and deposited in the Tree. (The same
location as always.) You may then proceed to [train](Train "wikilink")
and get newbie [eq](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") as usual. If, for any
reason, you do NOT wish to be promoted to [level](Level "wikilink") 2,
simply type "n" and you will be deposited in Mudschool and you can
\<[recall](Recall "wikilink")\> out to [Nom](Nom "wikilink") and begin
as you prefer.*

*If you say "no" you will begin in Avatar's Mudschool. The instruction
unfolds [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") by
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"), and
[IMMs](:Category:_Immortals "wikilink") and
[Angels](:Category:_Angels "wikilink") helping new players might station
themselves in the first few [rooms](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink").
Mudschool 3 is particularly useful as it gives instructions on the
'[say](Say "wikilink")' [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"), so a
new player is more likely to be able to talk to you.*

*Players from [Level](Level "wikilink") 1 to [Level](Level "wikilink") 5
are welcome to walk through the school and/or help a friend get started.
Players over [Level](Level "wikilink") 5 are not allowed to enter
Mudschool. Please do not use the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in
Mudschool to equip your alts. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should players of
any [level](Level "wikilink") bother, [follow](Follow "wikilink"), or
[tell](Tell "wikilink") to [Level](Level "wikilink") 1 players. They do
not have the ability to [reply](Reply "wikilink") or
[tell](Tell "wikilink") at that [level](Level "wikilink") and it is very
confusing to have someone say, "Hi, welcome to Avatar!" when you cannot
see or [reply](Reply "wikilink") to them. It is TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE to
offer to group with or bring [equipment](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") to
these [Level](Level "wikilink") 1 newbies. They need to complete the
journey through Mudschool if at all possible. At completion of the
Mudschool curriculum these players will request promotion to
[level](Level "wikilink") 2, and [recall](Recall "wikilink") to
[Nom](Nom "wikilink").*

*One CANNOT walk to Mudschool... it is much like the
[Sanctum](:Category:_Sanctum "wikilink") and the
[Arena](:Category:_Avatar_Arena "wikilink") in that one types
\<[mudschool](Mudschool "wikilink")\> to get in and
\<[recall](Recall "wikilink")\> to get out. There is no connection to
any [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") in Avatar.*

**Level Range:** 1-1

**Builder:** Darii

## Directions

Up until [level](Level "wikilink") 5 you can simply type
'[mudschool](Mudschool "wikilink")'. Otherwise, the
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") is not accessible.

## Connections

Mudschool connects with no other [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink").

## Navigation

This area is linear, and following the path will instruct new players
how to play.

## Adventuring

This is <u>the</u> newbie area. Head here if you are new to mudding or
to Avatar in general. It'll teach you all about how to play and even set
you up with some early [gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink").
