*Prone to [bloodlust](Bloodlust "wikilink")? Have a passion for death
and dismemberment? You might have what it takes to succeed in the bloody
and brutal world of Berserkers!*

*Berserkers are powerful fighters whose ferocity and disregard for their
own safety make them truly devastating and almost impervious to damage
under the right circumstances. They thrive in tumultuous combat, leading
a group and battling on the front lines. Traditionally they wear very
little armor, in order to maximize their destructive potential.*

*Once they attain level 51, Berserkers do not gain new class skills in
the usual manner, instead selecting from a list of
[Rites](Rites "wikilink") at specific sublevels.*

*Berserkers NEVER learn any magic spells except homeshift, which is good
because they never gain mana. The [PRIME
REQUISITES](Prime_Requisite "wikilink") of berserkers is
[STRENGTH](Strength "wikilink"). They are only available to
[warriors](:Category:_Warriors "wikilink"),
[rogues](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") and old
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") via the REMORT command.*

**Abbreviation:** Bzk.

## Berserkers in General

Berserkers are a pure melee class; they never gain mana or learn any
spells. At hero they get comparable hp to a warrior; at lord, a bit more
(warrior hp is multiplied by 4 on morph from hero to lord, whereas
berserker is multiplied by 4.5. So a hero with 10k hp would be 40k as
war at lord 1, or 45k as a bzk). They almost always run in hit gear.
They hit considerably better when tanking the mob than without, and thus
serve as good tanks and rescuers. Their lack of spells means that they
rely on their groupmates more than usual. They use blunt weapons to hit.

## Berserker Creation

Berserkers are only creatable via the [remort](Remort "wikilink")
command. See the [remort classes](:Category:Remort_Classes "wikilink")
page for options and at what level. Good creatable races include orc
(decent hp and damage, low tnl), ogre (quite a bit more hp and damage, a
bit more tnl) and giant (most hp, damage, and tnl), gargoyles (for golem
option - usually people remort golem first before bzk).

## Berserkers at Lowmort Tier

### Training

Once remorted, you should have enough practice points to practice all
your attributes to maximum. Should you not have enough, for odd reasons,
Constitution is the most important attribute (for HP gains), since
Intelligence is generally not a factor, and neither is Wisdom - there is
a very small amount of skills to be practiced over Lomort tier, and
virtually none once you Hero, so measly practice point gains and slow
learning due to low intelligence are not an issue.

Of note is that berserkers do not get [Magic
Lore](Magic_Lore "wikilink"); so they are consigned to an eternity of
"very long" and "for a while" after Lowmort level 25. See [Magic
Lore](Magic_Lore "wikilink") for a guide to the duration ranges of the
various descriptors.

### Practicing

Practice all skills as they become available, as a majority is useful.
Some less immediately useful ones are [Kick](Kick "wikilink"),
[Toss](Toss "wikilink") (Toss has a long lag if failed) or
[Butcher](Butcher "wikilink"), but since there is only [so few of
them](:Category:Berserker_Lowmort_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") you
might as well practice all.

### Worshipping

Werredan with the hp and xp benefits is a good choice, as with any
warrior class - lack if mana gains is not an issue for mana-less
berserkers, and the experience bonus is always nice.
[Worshiping](Worship "wikilink") other deities makes little practical
sense.

### Fighting

**Soloing:**

Lowmort is mostly a solo affair. With large HP gains and early access to
skills such as [Third Attack](Third_Attack "wikilink") and [Blunt
Weaponry](Blunt_Weaponry "wikilink"), a berserker will always solo in
[hit-gear](:Category:Hit_Gear "wikilink"), pausing only for so long to
replenish HP or spells. Remember to upgrade gear every 10 levels or so,
and complete all [Diplomatic
Corps](:Category:Diplomatic_Corps "wikilink") quests if you have not
completed them in your previous incarnation.

**Tanking:**

Berserkers at these levels will likely have more HP than groupies, so
role of a tank is simple due to early access to
[Dodge](Dodge "wikilink") and [Rescue](Rescue "wikilink"). Grouping a
healer can be effective since a lack of AC gear will mean more damage
taken over runs.

**Hitting:**

Similar to soloing, but with less risk, a berserker can easily dish out
appropriate amounts of damage behind a tank clad in AC gear, as well as
serve as a backup tank. Unfortunately lowmort groups are rare, so it's
not often an opportunity to [sponge](Sponge "wikilink") like this will
present itself.

## Berserker Prestige Options

There are no prestige options for berserkers at this time.

## Berserkers at Hero Tier

### Training

Train your constitution first and foremost in order to maximize the HP
gains. Intelligence is not relevant due to no mana gains and a miniscule
amount of skills to be practiced, and Wisdom is also not relevant due
to - again, only a few skills to be practiced. However, do train all
attributes once you have the opportunity, if only to provide a buffer
for stat loses at post Hero 101, as well as a potential pool of practice
points for buying HP directly, if such a practice is interesting to you.

### Practicing

Unlike most classes - berserkers do not get spells. At hero 1 they
acquire rites. Every 100 levels they are allowed to pick one rite to
learn. Some rites are only functional when the berserker's AC rating are
under a certain level (-750 max for heros and -1250 for lords). The
options are:

∗ These six rites are pre-requisites for lord rites (there are six lord
rites).

#### Which rites to get

Bloodlust and resist pain are the first two to get (order depends on
what you want to do - usually bloodlust is first). Deathblow is next.
Those are the most important ones; the rest are much less important.
Useful ones to get are warcry, wail, guard crush and final fury (when
you have enough hp). You will need to learn might at some point, since
it's required for a lord rite.

### Devoting

It is not uncommon for fighter classes to devote Werredan:

`    Str  Int  Wis  Dex  Con  `  
`    +1   -1    0   -1   +1`

Remember that post 101 your (potential) DC insignia will fade, and to
gain a full bonus to constitution (+4 over maximum trainable) you will
likely need to wear appropriate [leveling
gear](:Category:Con_Gear "wikilink").

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Berserkers are very solo-able. Early on the rite Bloodlust
is very handy to maintain the HP while running in full hit gear. Unless
your HPs can handle swarms stick to non-aggie areas.

**Tanking:** Tanking at hero with a berserker is fairly simple and
straight forward. The first two rites you should take are resist pain
and bloodlust. Resist pain will allow you to fight for the first 2-3
rounds of combat without taking any noticeable damage. Since berserkers
can regain health via the bloodlust rite, their dependence on healing is
less than that of other tanks. The best hitters to bring when tanking at
hero would be archers and casters. This is because casters and archers
can stop most if not all of their damage at any given time allowing the
berserker a far greater chance of landing the killing blow and gaining
health through bloodlust.

Grouporder yourself front, as the top hitting slot tends to get more
terminal blows. If you don't have an attentive archer/caster who times
their damage to give you the terms, then lowhero warriors can be good
because they are fairly weak yet still do consistent damage.

Enchanted hitgear is the way to go, because you want to do enough damage
to get the terms. A secondary hitset with lower ac is helpful so that
you can keep your ac below -750 for bloodlust when your frenzy falls
mid-combat (and a good alias to swap between sets).

**Hitting:**

For pre-250, two regular very good edged damage weapons will outperform
a blunt doublehit weapon. After 250, a blunt double-hit weapon is best.
[Sceptre Of Igecsoz](Sceptre_Of_Igecsoz "wikilink") is a good fodderable
weapon.

Once you get enough hp, using [Final Fury](Final_Fury "wikilink") can be
fun. For final fury to work, you need to have less than 10% of your max
hp. Scar often to keep your hp below 10%.

### Lord Play in General

The most important rites to get are ignore pain, savage strength and
mutilation, so save at least these many (plus one for might if you
haven't got it yet). The rest are much less important.

Berzerkers receive a lot of hp at lord and usually serve to rescue
groupmembers. Using the ignore pain rite, they take very little damage.
They are very useful in tanking gear rooms for this reason. The benefits
of ignore pain degrade after about three rounds, so it is standard to
rescue the bzk after three rounds. For this reason, they cannot serve as
the main tank in the group; you need at least one other tank.

### Some tips

Berserker at lord can't eulogy without mana, so consider whether there
are enough players on-line to thren if you are going to an area that is
difficult to CR.

It's quite fun at lord to use final fury (FF) under the watchful eye of
a good healer, because the extra damage is sexy. The bzk needs to keep
hp under 10% in order for FF to kick in. It is polite to inform the
healers that you are going for FF so that they don't waste mana healing
you while you are trying to get your hp to 10%.

Berserkers tank missile damage well, so leaders will tell groupmates not
to disarm bow mobs when bzk are in the group to tank it.

Since you can use config +savespell for spell effects from
[Mutilation](Mutilation "wikilink"), you could scar until achieving
[Werrebocler](Werrebocler "wikilink"), get healed back to full as fast
as possible, and then get spelled with the rest of the group. This would
help if a Berserker were to be sent in to a plane as the first tank.
Normally planeshift lag is too long, and the Berserker would suffer
quite a bit after Ignore Pain degrades and before any other tank is out
of lag to rescue them.

## Berserker Remort Options

There are no remort class options for berserkers. Good remort races are
troll, minotaur and golem.

## "Bad Rites"

Rites are overdue for a rehaul, as many changes to the mud have rendered
some rites obsolete. The rites indicated above as "potentially bad" are
rites which many players now choose to avoid, as they either do not work
as described or have been rendered obsolete in some way.
