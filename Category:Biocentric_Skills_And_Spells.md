Biocentric spells are those which alter the body of the
[caster](Cast.md "wikilink") on a cellular level. These are fairly
simple for a [Psion](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") to learn, due
to his detailed psionic awareness of his own body; members of most other
[classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") can often master most of
these transformations after a bit of work. At lower
[levels](Level.md "wikilink"), these changes are mostly augmentations of
one of the body's natural abilities, such as [ADRENALINE
PUMP](Adrenaline_Pump.md "wikilink"). At higher
[levels](Level.md "wikilink") they include large-scale transmutations,
such as [IRON SKIN](Iron_Skin.md "wikilink"). [Bio
Empathy](Bio_Empathy.md "wikilink") is required to
[cast](Cast.md "wikilink") Biocentric spells on other
[people](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink").''
