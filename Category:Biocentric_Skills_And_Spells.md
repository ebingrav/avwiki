Biocentric spells are those which alter the body of the
[caster](Cast "wikilink") on a cellular level. These are fairly simple
for a [Psion](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") to learn, due to his
detailed psionic awareness of his own body; members of most other
[classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") can often master most of these
transformations after a bit of work. At lower
[levels](Level "wikilink"), these changes are mostly augmentations of
one of the body's natural abilities, such as [ADRENALINE
PUMP](Adrenaline_Pump "wikilink"). At higher [levels](Level "wikilink")
they include large-scale transmutations, such as [IRON
SKIN](Iron_Skin "wikilink"). [Bio Empathy](Bio_Empathy "wikilink") is
required to [cast](Cast "wikilink") Biocentric spells on other
[people](:Category:_Characters "wikilink").''
