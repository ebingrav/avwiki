*The Black Circle is a secretive cabal of lizard and Dragon-kin
assassins under the service of the Great Dragon Kahbyss. The Circle
teaches a small repertoire of [psionic
spells](:Category:_Psionicist_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink"),
including some unknown outside the circle. The Circle as a whole has a
certain measure of [Reputation](Reputation.md "wikilink"), although
individual Initiates cannot raise this, like an
[Assassin](:Category:_Assassins.md "wikilink") can.*

*Like all [Prestige Classes](:Category:_Prestige_Classes.md "wikilink"),
they retain the original class's [Prime
Requisite](Prime_Requisite.md "wikilink"), in this case,
[Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"). As a Psionic class, they possess a
Psion's higher degree of success with spells such as
[deception](Deception.md "wikilink"). Joining the Circle is for life.
Initiates cannot become [Assassins](:Category:_Assassins.md "wikilink")
or [Berserkers](:Category:_Berserkers.md "wikilink") like
[Rogues](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") can.*

*Rumor says the Circle maintains a base in warmer climes, where Masters
can often be found.*

*Requirements:  
*\* level 50 Rogue  
*\* Reptilian or similar race  
*\* Have an impressive "resume"  
*\* Avoid trouble with the law  
*\* Complete one "job" for the Circle

## BCIs in General

The Black Circle Initiate, is a
[Rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink")-like assassin with some unique
[psionic](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") abilities. BCI do not
get a lot of arcane spells but they have access to some impressive
psionics that only the
[psionicists](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") and
[Mnd](:Category:_Mindbenders.md "wikilink") can learn like
[overconfidence](Overconfidence.md "wikilink"), [anger
management](Anger_Management_.md "wikilink") and [death
field](Death_Field.md "wikilink"). Also BCI can learn a couple skills
unique only to the initiates like [sense
weakness](Sense_Weakness.md "wikilink") and [killer
instinct](Killer_Instinct.md "wikilink").

BCI gain stats identical to a mage. This means a balanced ratio of HP
and mana, that makes them able to use their abilities (namely [Death
Field](Death_Field "wikilink")) in combat.

Black Circle Initiates also get a certain
[reputation](reputation "wikilink") (20%) due to the nature of the
Circle but, unlike [Assassins](:Category:_Assassins.md "wikilink"), this
is not earned and can not be lost.

## BCI Creation

BCI is a possible class option only for lizard-kin (and fake lizard-kin)
races: [troglodytes](Troglodytes.md "wikilink"),
[draconians](Draconians.md "wikilink"),
[firedrakes](Firedrakes.md "wikilink"),
[lizardmen](Lizardmen.md "wikilink") and [miraar](miraar "wikilink")
rogues. Remort races that can become BCI are
[dragons](dragons "wikilink") and [tuataurs](tuataurs "wikilink"). [
Imps](:Category:Imps.md "wikilink") can become a BCI whilst a Dust Imp
since they have the racial characteristic 'Scaled Race'.

The [BCI master](:Category:Black_Circle_Initiate_Trainers.md "wikilink")
can be found at the bottom of the [Valley of the
Sun](:Category:Valley_Of_The_Sun.md "wikilink"). Requirements are:

-   One of the races listed above,
-   Spotless criminal record - ie. **NO** arrests,
-   A large kill counter - about 333 at lvl 50, 359 at hero 1, and
    rising fast afterwards (433 at hero 5).

With this in mind, linger in lower xp areas when leveling at lowmort and
try to rack up the kill counter. Remember that kills need to give xp to
add to the counter. Once ready and level 50, the [BCI
master](:Category:Black_Circle_Initiate_Trainers.md "wikilink") will
give you a quest. If you try to prestige and the Master replies: 'Yeah,
I've heard of you, but I haven't heard much. How do I know you've got
what it takes?' it means you still need more kills.

### The Quest

`A Black Circle Master says 'Yeah, maybe you do have what it takes.`  
`Maybe you could do a little job for us, hrmm? Those two bunglers I `  
`sent on the Audis job are taking too long...'`

From Lord Audis go: w, d, s, s, u, e.

In the second-to-last room there is a large mob with sanc and poison and
that stabs. The item you're looking for is the [Audis family
crest](Audis_Family_Crest_(Ticket).md "wikilink"). It's on Nikoli.
Murder Nikoli and return the item.

This is a ticket quest in [Lord Audis'
Villa](:Category:_Lord_Audis'_Villa.md "wikilink") where it is easy to
get [arrested](Arrests.md "wikilink") so be careful. The aggressive
assassins there stab hard and fighting them in the presence of a guard
will give you an [outlaw flag](:Category:Character_Flags.md "wikilink").
If the servant spots you there, you'll get an outlaw flag too, even
without any fighting. Outlaws might find a reprieve from the Black
Circle Master, but once you are arrested, he will ignore you forever.
You are required to do this quest with the alt that wants to go BCI.

Once you give the required item to the master, you can use the
[prestige](prestige "wikilink") command and become BCI.

## BCIs at Hero Tier

While it might appear there is little difference between BCI and Rogues
at low hero, except that BCI receive less of the useful spells, this is
not quite accurate. At hero 33 BCI can learn
[Deception](Deception "wikilink") which can be very handy against mobs
that wield. Also, starting at hero 11 they learn a series of six psionic
damage spells, starting with [Psychic Drain](Psychic_Drain "wikilink")
and culminating with [Ultrablast](Ultrablast "wikilink") at hero 91.
Coupled with [Surge](Surge "wikilink") (hero 49) these spells can add
noticeable damage during a fight.
[Overconfidence](Overconfidence "wikilink") can also be useful against
mobs that flee, particularly flying ones (which can't be tripped).

After 101 they come into their own, as they are able to both stab as a
rogue and to use [Death Field](Death_Field "wikilink") for tremendous
area damage, to name but a few of their primary abilities. They can also
use [Quickcast](Quickcast "wikilink") and
[Shadowcast](Shadowcast "wikilink") to add certain psionic spells to a
mid-round vital shot or an opening surprise attack. Max bci surge is 3.

### Training

Train [wisdom](Wisdom.md "wikilink") first and then
[intelligence](Intelligence.md "wikilink"), for the increased prac and
mana gains. Next comes [constitution](Constitution.md "wikilink") for
better [hp](Hit_Points.md "wikilink") gains, and finally train strength
and dexterity at your leisure.

### Practicing

It is important to practice the following skills and spells at hero:

-   [Nightcloak](Nightcloak "wikilink") - increase stealth of a race,
    potentially making certain races immune to failing stealth checks,
-   [Backstab](Backstab "wikilink") - the bread and butter of rogue
    skills, required for stabbing,
-   [Death Field](Death_Field "wikilink") - incredibly potent area
    attack with a nasty potential for backfire,
-   [Overconfidence](Overconfidence "wikilink") - useful for dealing
    with wimpy mobs,
-   [Sense Weakness](Sense_Weakness "wikilink") - only marginally useful
    at hero tier due to the speed at which mobs usually die,
-   [Quickstrike](Quickstrike "wikilink") and [Killer
    Instinct](Killer_Instinct "wikilink") - useful when soloing to
    increase damage dealt.

You may want to look into the following spells:

-   [Enhanced Strength](Enhanced_Strength "wikilink") - Useful
    replacement for Giant Strength,
-   [Ectoplasmic Form](Ectoplasmic_Form "wikilink") - Useful replacement
    for Pass Door,
-   [Heighten Senses](Heighten_Senses "wikilink") - Since you are
    psi-like, this lasts the full duration of spells

Spells BCI do **not** get require special attention:

-   [Portal](Portal "wikilink"), [Nexus](Nexus "wikilink"),
-   [Awen](Awen "wikilink"), though they do receive the spells of the
    [Awen](Awen "wikilink") stack.

### Worship and Devoting

Where rogues had a relatively easy dilemma between Shizaga and Tor, BCI
have a much harder choice to make.

**Shizaga** is great for "smart" races - those wishing to maximize their
mana gains, and that will rely on death field to do damage. This in turn
leads to ability to solo akin to mages - using surged death field and a
charged shield to clear large amounts of enemies at once while relying
on tank gear and not using melee abilities. Alternatively, "strong"
races such as [Black Dragons](Black_Dragons "wikilink") can still do
significant melee damage with a Shizaga worship, and thanks to large hp
pools and good racial armor run in full hit gear. Shizaga gives bonuses
to spell damage, better mana gains, bonuses to rogue skills like
backstab and is far better for poisoning weapons.

**Tor** will nerf mana gains and spell damage while boosting melee,
making it more suitable for the "brutish" BCI - those seeking to
maximize stab damage and hitting power, and that will use death field
only sparringly.

**Excerpt from [Devotion](Devotion "wikilink") Effects Table**

\|}

As with worship, each devotion suits its particular gameplay style.

Shizaga will give bonus AC useful for soloing or tanking, where Tor
devotion will increase damage and HP gains while further reducing mana
gains.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Soloing might be a bit tricky until after level 101, but
follows two routes:

-   Fight in [mixed gear](Tanking_In_Hit_Gear.md "wikilink") by blinding
    mobs (*vs eye*) or later by [backstabbing](Backstab.md "wikilink")
    them. Augment damage by quickstrikes or ultrablasts.

<!-- -->

-   Alternatively, after 101 go into full AC with a charged shield, and
    fight many mobs at once using [Death Field](Death_Field "wikilink").

**Tanking:** BCI tank rather well with [*bs*](Backstab.md "wikilink") or
[*vs eye*](Vital_Shot.md "wikilink") to open up combat. At low hero you
will need full [ac gear](:Category:Hero_Tank_Gear.md "wikilink") and
then slowly blend in [hit](:Category:Hero_Hit_Gear.md "wikilink") to
suit your playing style. Be sure to include someone in the group who can
[portal](Portal.md "wikilink") and [sanc](Sanctuary.md "wikilink").

**Hitting:** BCI don't really start hitting well until they get [third
attack](Third_Attack.md "wikilink") and [enhanced
damage](Enhanced_Damage.md "wikilink"). When in groups they should be
stabbing in full DR gear (and immediately rescued by actual tanks), and
using DF for rooms with 3+ mobs.

**Healing:** Since BCI do not get [Arcane
Knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge "wikilink") they cannot brand or zap. They
do have access to [Heal](Heal "wikilink") in emergencies (but not
[Augment](Augment "wikilink")).

## BCIs at Lord Tier

BCIs continue to be powerful characters at the lord tier, although
overshadowed by assassins and especially by rogues.
[Nightcloak](Nightcloak "wikilink") will insure your continuing high
stab rate, and in-class [Regeneration](Regeneration "wikilink") can be
nice. In addition, BCI can cast [Steel
Skeleton](Steel_Skeleton "wikilink") on group members.

Unfortunately the BCIs do not receive [Slip](Slip "wikilink") or
[Disengage](Disengage "wikilink") but they can still open with a stab
and let another rogue or assassin slip in for later damage.

Depending on your race, you can either [Sense
Weakness](Sense_Weakness "wikilink") and [Vital
Shot](Vital_Shot "wikilink") midround, or
[Mindwipe](Mindwipe "wikilink") the mobs for a nice little boost in
damage.

## BCI Remort Options

BCI has no class remort options; BCI is for life.

Strong, otherwise non-sneaky races such as
[minotaurs](minotaurs "wikilink"), [dragons](dragons "wikilink") and
[trolls](trolls "wikilink") make great remort choices for BCI, as the
skill [nightcloak](nightcloak "wikilink") allows them to rarely miss
their stab.

Dragons do exceptionally well, with their mix of high racial damage and
strong casting abilities, excelling at all aspects of BCI, and in
addition, are able to become a BCI even if not originally BCI. After
all, [Kahbyss](Kahbyss "wikilink") founded the Circle, and he is a black
dragon.

For those shy of a dragon's TNL and death-field related deaths,
[tuataurs](Tuataurs.md "wikilink") are also a good option - good
sneaking, powerful casters, but without the damage modifier and not as
armored.
