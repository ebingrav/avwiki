*Long ago, in the time of the Great [Fae](Fae.md "wikilink"), there
lived a [warrior](:Category:_Warriors.md "wikilink") of sublime grace
and cunning, known as Tessrah Bladedancer. She developed a unique
fighting style which she taught to some of her fellow
[Fae](Fae.md "wikilink"), and which was passed down among the [High
Elves](High_Elves.md "wikilink") after her death. Most [High
Elf](High_Elves.md "wikilink") Bladedancers were killed in the Second
Great War, and the [Fae](Fae.md "wikilink") who remember the art do not
teach it to Midgaardians. Legend describes it as a semi-magical fighting
style concentrating on misdirection and surprise. Like all [Prestige
Classes](:Category:_Prestige_Classes.md "wikilink"), they retain the
original class's [Prime Requisite](Prime_Requisite.md "wikilink"), in
this case, [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"). As the Bladedance is a
highly passionate fighting style, Bladedancers can become
[Berserkers](:Category:_Berserkers.md "wikilink") earlier than
[Rogues](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink"). However, they cannot become
[Assassins](:Category:_Assassins.md "wikilink").*

## Bladedancers in General

In general Bladedancers are a melee class, low on spell casting with no
in-class spells of their own, but with plenty of mana for secondary
support or utility spells. They can take the role of tank or hitter with
equal ease, drifting between the two as they need, more than competent
in both positions, though not the best at either. Most similar in
game-play to [Rogues](:Category:Rogues.md "wikilink"), they are a
versatile class with plenty of different options and a solid set of
things to do in any group. With their [Stances](Stance "wikilink"), and
high number of hits, Bladedancers can also resemble armed monks to some
degree - [Dexterity](Dexterity "wikilink") being a prime stat and mana
being acquired easily but with little or no focus on it (aside from
[Bladetrance](Bladetrance "wikilink") at lord). In some ways,
Bladedancers could be seen to take the place of the old [Martial
Artists](:Category:Martial_Artists.md "wikilink"), but with more
emphasis on combat and less on spell casting.

## Bladedancer Creation

At level 50, [Rogues](:Category:Rogues.md "wikilink") who meet the
following requirements may become Bladedancers;

-   Female - No male characters may become Bladedancers, nor neuter.
-   0(zero) Deaths - Your character may not have died up until this
    point, ever. If you are not sure if you have died or not so far,
    type score to find out.
-   No, or, very very low racial damage modifier. Current known races:
    [Drw](Drow.md "wikilink"), [Elf](Elves.md "wikilink"),
    [Gob](Goblins.md "wikilink"), [Gno](Gnomes.md "wikilink"),
    [Dgn](Deep_Gnome.md "wikilink"), [Hel](Half-Elves.md "wikilink"),
    [Har](Harpy.md "wikilink"), [HiE](High_Elves.md "wikilink"),
    [Hum](Human.md "wikilink"), [Kzn](Kzinti.md "wikilink"),
    [Liz](Lizardmen.md "wikilink"), [Mir](Miraar.md "wikilink"),
    [Spr](Sprites.md "wikilink"), [Cen](Centaur.md "wikilink") and
    presumably a number of other unconfirmed races.
-   [Poise](Poise "wikilink") practiced.
-   You may not have [Racial Evil](Racial_Evil "wikilink"). Due to this,
    [Hob](Hobgoblin.md "wikilink") and [Dsd](Demonseed.md "wikilink")
    are not able to become Bladedancers. If a Bladedancer remorts to a
    race with Racial Evil they will suffer a small mana cost penalty to
    some Bladedancer spells.

If all these requirements are met, find [Araxia](Araxia "wikilink") in
[the Kingdom of the
Willows](:Category:Kingdom_Of_The_Willows.md "wikilink") to be inducted
into this [Prestige Class](:Category:Prestige_Classes.md "wikilink").

With [Dodge](Dodge "wikilink") being such an essential skill for
Bladedancers in that it so strongly affects their stances, races with
higher [dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"), rather than lower, would
seem to be better suited to this Prestige Class. With creatable races,
this would be Kzinti. Furthermore, as [Racial
Fly](Racial_Fly "wikilink") has a positive affect on one's chance to hit
(i.e, negate a target's Dodge), then Harpy, or Sprite with Remort, may
also prove to be good choices. Other races too may have advantages in
play for Bladedancers, depending on play style. Lizardmen's use of tail
to stun will increase the chance of dodging, while elves and drow will
be able to make effective use of the Bladedancer's surplus of mana.

Also with the addition of [Bladetrance](Bladetrance "wikilink") this
gives more use of the Bladedancers mana (especially at lord).
Bladetrance mana cost per tick is possibly modified by a number of
factors, which were highlighted in the testing phase helps these
included:

-   size (larger size has higher cost),
-   stealth (worse stealth has higher cost),
-   sex (non-female has slightly higher cost),
-   'bruteness' (higher has higher cost),
-   align or racial evilness

## Bladedancer Quests

Bladedancers have five quests by which they can unlock and improve the
bladetrance ability.  
See [HELP BLADEDANCER QUESTS](Bladedancer_Quests.md "wikilink") for more
information. The first quest is available at Hero 675.

<small>(No spoilers, please.)</small>

## Bladedancers at Hero Tier

### Training

Bladedancers at [hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink")
[tier](:Category:_Tiers.md "wikilink") will be able to
[train](Train.md "wikilink") their [dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink")
five higher than at [lowmort](:Category:_Lowmort.md "wikilink")
[tier](:Category:_Tiers.md "wikilink") and to
[train](Train.md "wikilink") their other
[statistics](:Category:_Statistics.md "wikilink") two higher than at
[lowmort](:Category:_Lowmort.md "wikilink")
[tier](:Category:_Tiers.md "wikilink"). They will continue to be able to
raise each of their [statistics](:Category:_Statistics.md "wikilink") up
to three more than they can [train](Train.md "wikilink") them to
(respectively), unless they [devote](Devotion.md "wikilink") themselves
to a [deity](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses.md "wikilink"), in which case
these amounts may be modified slightly. See *Devoting* below for more
information about this subject.

### Practicing

Bladedancers practice with [Araxia](Araxia "wikilink") in [Kingdom of
the Willows](:Category:Kingdom_Of_The_Willows.md "wikilink"). [Sublime
Grace](Sublime_Grace "wikilink") is the first skill which should be
practiced. This is the central skill for Bladedancers as it is a
prerequisite for a number of other skills later on down the line, but
beyond that it gives the ability to hit more often.

[Enhanced Damage](Enhanced_Damage "wikilink") and [Third
Attack](Third_Attack "wikilink") are possibly the most important skills
to learn post-hero, as with Sublime Grace they will increase your hits
to potentially six per round and the damage of each hit. Other skills or
spells are essentially only as useful as you find them. However,
Bladedancers appear to make reasonably good mana gains and
[Drow](Drow "wikilink") and [Elves](Elves "wikilink"), for example, may
be able to make good use of their no-fail quality to work as support or
utility casters.

Once at 101, Bladancers will be able to practice
[Balance](Balance "wikilink") to increase the range of weapons they will
be able to make use of effectively, learn
[Quickstrike](Quickstrike "wikilink") and gain access to their
[Stances](Stance.md "wikilink"). [Bladedance](Bladedance "wikilink")
will only be useful when soloing or tanking, and [Inspiring
Dance](Inspiring_Dance "wikilink") only for the later when leading mana
users. [Dervish Dance](Dervish_Dance "wikilink"), however, can be used
from any position within the group.

### Devoting

[Shizaga](Shizaga "wikilink") gives an increase to both mana gains and
rogue damage. Also, [devoting](Devotion.md "wikilink") will give a +1 to
maximum [dexterity](dexterity "wikilink"). However, Shizaga reduces
melee damage. [Tor](Tor "wikilink") increases both rogue and melee
damage, and if devoted gives +1 [constitution](constitution "wikilink")
and +2 [strength](strength "wikilink"), but does reduce mana gains.
Also, remember that worship affects crafting skills such as [ poison
weapon](Poison_Weapon.md "wikilink") (tor is much worse than shz).

### Fighting

Prior to 101, Bladedancers fight in a very similar way to
[Rogues](:Category:Rogues.md "wikilink") and even afterwards, there are
more similarities than differences to their play styles. They are
reasonably versatile from the very beginning and can take tank or hit
positions, and their ability to solo steadily increases as they advance
in levels, as with all classes. Unlike rogues however, hit roll is
important for Bladedancers. After 101 you will probably need at least 4
hits (out of 6 possible) to land to do decent damage.

**Soloing:**

Bladedancers do not solo especially well prior to 101. However, by the
time they get [Quickstrike](Quickstrike "wikilink") and access to their
[Stances](Stances "wikilink"), they should have built up enough of a hp
reserve to be able to take some damage. With a solid set of tank gear
and [Bladedance](Bladedance "wikilink"), the player should be able to
solo level 60 or so mobs without much problem. In hit gear the speed of
fights increases significantly, but so does the need for quaffs or some
other form of healing during or between fights. [Inspiring
Dance](Inspiring_Dance "wikilink") is of no use when soloing, as you
cannot monitor yourself, and [Dervish Dance](Dervish_Dance "wikilink")
is probably only of much use in situations which are going to cause you
some pain, until you gain several thousand spare hps.

**Tanking:**

With a decent set of tank gear, Bladedancers can tank from level 1 hero.
However, with low hps it is inadvisable without a decent healer along on
the run, or a significant amount of potions. Their high
[Dexterity](Dexterity "wikilink") makes them naturally good at tanking,
but without using a shield, [Rogues](:Category:Rogues.md "wikilink")
will have the edge in this field until 101. As with rogues, popular
theory is to start fights using [Vital Shot](Vital_Shot "wikilink") to
the eye to create blindness, or [Sneak Attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink")
for more significant early damage, depending on the individual
preference and the size of the mob.

Once at 101, a tanking Bladedancer will probably not want to use a
shield at all, if they have even used one so far. This is because they
now have access to [Bladedance](Bladedance "wikilink") and [Inspiring
Dance](Inspiring_Dance "wikilink"). Bladedance will allow the
Bladedancer to hit back each time they dodge an attack, providing they
are making use of [Sublime Grace](Sublime_Grace "wikilink") to use
identical weapons, which can increase a Bladedancer's hits from six to
eight or even nine in a round. For this reason, using a second weapon
and taking a hit to one's AC may be preferable to simply carrying a
shield. In addition, rather than simply using purely defensive weapons
(eg. [Captain Dieme's Saber](Captain_Dieme's_Saber "wikilink")), some
may find this tactic more effective if using a pair of 'normal' attack
weapons which have been [runed](Rune.md "wikilink") with AC bonuses.
Essentially, dropping from a [Shield Of
Heroes](Shield_Of_Heroes "wikilink") and Dieme's Saber to a pair of
sabers will worsen the Bladedancer's AC by as much as 66 (or more, if
the shield is enchanted), but will give the Bladedancer an extra three
attacks and allow them to use Bladedance. By substituting a pair of
runed [Blood-Soaked Rapiers](Blood-Soaked_Rapier "wikilink") for the
sabers, then the AC will worsen by only another 10, but the hit and dam
rolls will increase by 18 each (more if the rapiers are enchanted),
which is a significant improvement if the Bladedancer is also seeking to
do some damage while tanking.

Also only useful in tank position is the [Inspiring
Dance](Inspiring_Dance "wikilink") stance, which is also only useful if
you are tanking for mana users. That said, it is a VERY useful stance
which can almost fully recharge a mana pool in just a few short ticks.
Additional mana for your groupies means longer runs, more healing for
you, and greater ability for groupies to surge larger mobs to name just
a few reasons to use this stance.

Finally, [Dervish Dance](Dervish_Dance "wikilink") is a very effective
way to combat a large group of mobs in one room, starting with a
[Burning Hands](Burning_Hands "wikilink") spell (or something similar)
to catch all the mobs attentions. As long as the Bladedancer's AC can
hold up to the onslaught, or if they have an effective healer grouped,
it allows the casters at the back to let loose with [Acid
Rain](Acid_Rain "wikilink") or [Earthquakes](Earthquakes "wikilink") and
you contribute automatically to the area effect mayhem.

**Hitting:**

With [Enhanced Damage](Enhanced_Damage "wikilink") and [Third
Attack](Third_Attack "wikilink") allowing six attacks each round,
Bladedancers can find themselves doing more damage than a warrior of the
same race, even before 101. With the addition of
[Quickstrike](Quickstrike "wikilink") at 101 into the bargain they can
kick out a significant amount of damage each round and should find
themselves a welcome hitter for any group. It should be noted though
that Quickstrike will be less effective in larger groups, as many mobs
will simply be dead before there is a chance to use it and that warriors
of races with strong damage modifiers will still likely do more damage
than your average Bladedancer.

A [Sneak Attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink") trigger to activate off the
tank's target will increase a Bladedancer's effectiveness in combat, as
will the use of [poisoned weapons](Poison_Weapon.md "wikilink"). With
sneak attack it's important to note that only about half will get
through, so a normal kill trigger should be set to fire in this case. In
general it is a good idea to use a different poison on each weapon, as
Bladedancer's use both weapons equally well. Depending on the group
make-up, [tripping](Trip.md "wikilink") or [tossing](Toss.md "wikilink")
may be useful additions to the usual moves and with nothing better to do
in a longer fight, a [surged 2](Surge.md "wikilink")
[Desiccate](Desiccate "wikilink") or [Ultrablast](Ultrablast "wikilink")
can give you something to do.

At hero 800 a bladedancer can practice [Sublime
Flow](Sublime_Flow "wikilink"). This will allow vital strikes even with
cutting (slicing or slashing) weapons. However note that only piercing
weapons can be poisoned. It is unclear if the damage increase from
Sublime Flow is enough to offset the loss of poison weapons.

[Dervish Dance](Dervish_Dance "wikilink") is the only Bladedancer
[stance](Stance.md "wikilink") which is likely to be of any real use to
you from a hit position (ignoring the advent of an aggie mob jumping
you). However, this stance is only useful if **two or more** mobs are
attacking your group at once. Striking automatically at each additional
attacker beyond the first who is attacking anyone in your group is
useful in aggressive or assisty areas, and areas which get swarmy. Where
it really comes into its own though, is when you are part of an Area
Effect run, probably lead by a [Mage](:Category:Mages.md "wikilink") or
[Wizard](:Category:Wizards.md "wikilink") who is using [Acid
Rain](Acid_Rain "wikilink") a lot.

**Healing:**

Bladedancers do not make effective healers. All of their healing spells
are out of class, and thus cause an extra round of lag. Without access
to [Augment](Augment "wikilink"), their healing is slow and basic and
caps out at the [Heal](Heal "wikilink") spell. That said, Bladedancers
often have a surfeit of mana, and prior to 101 and
[Quickstrike](Quickstrike "wikilink") may find themselves with little to
do in a fight. In such circumstances, Bladedancers, especially those who
are no-fail like [Drow](Drow "wikilink") and [Elves](Elves "wikilink"),
are useful for topping up a group member's hps. Likewise, the ability to
[brandish](Brandish.md "wikilink") here can be a useful enhancement to a
run. However, Bladedancers should probably not be counted on to act as
primary healers.

## Bladedancers at Lord Tier

Bladedancers finally come into their own at the Lord tier, when they
obtain the [Veil Of Blades](Veil_Of_Blades "wikilink") stance. This
stance reduces all enemies' ability to hit for its duration, effectively
increasing group member's AC. [Inspiring
Dance](Inspiring_Dance "wikilink") also scales extremely well with the
caster-heavy Lord metagame, providing a significant boost to all group
members' abilities to deal damage and heal others.

Bladedancers are at their best when there are two in a group, as this
allows a stance rotation to occur: one Bladedancer veils while the other
tanks with inspiring up, and then they switch when the stances are on
cooldown to create a continuous loop. Veil from multiple Bladedancers
also stacks, to the extent where two players at a high trance level can
effectively disarm gear rooms.

Like any lord with Quickstrike, Bladedancers can use
[Quickstrike](Quickstrike "wikilink") and [Vital
Shot](Vital_Shot "wikilink") mid-round at lord level to target eyes and
blind (those mobs that have eyes anyway).
