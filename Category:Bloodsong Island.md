*The Bloodsong is what [Minotaurs](Minotaurs "wikilink") call the sound
the wind makes as it blows through the tunnels of this small island.
They claim it is the voice of [Tor](Tor "wikilink"), and it makes them
[stronger](Strength "wikilink"), [tougher](Armor_Class "wikilink"), and
far more [aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"). Outsiders are
extremely unwelcome. The island was once attached to [Paradise
Point](:Category:_Paradise_Point "wikilink"), but was blasted apart from
the mainland years ago to make it easier to conquer the more tame
[minotaurs](Minotaurs "wikilink") there. So far it hasn't helped.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

## Naviation

The area has three layers of similar sizes, of which the first two are
completely anti-magic. No rooms are cursed so recall/mercy at will.

## Adventuring

Bloodsong Island is a multi-level area that is near [Paradise
Point](:Category:_Paradise_Point "wikilink"). This area is a favorite
duo place for some [rogues](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink"), but you
should be warned that most of it is
[no-spell](Anti-Magic_Rooms "wikilink"). The [portal](Portal "wikilink")
point to the area is [Nenba](Nenba_The_Archer "wikilink").  
*<Font color=red>Warning: Bloodlusters [eat
corpses](Corpse-Eating_Mobs "wikilink"), and other
[minotaurs](Minotaurs "wikilink") [can
stomp](:Category:_Stomping_Mobs "wikilink").</font>*

Most of the minotaurs cannot see move hidden. Also note that they are
berserkers, so you will hit less than normal.

## Affects

As of October 2011, the area features a tiny increase in experience
gains and a major increase in hp regen.
