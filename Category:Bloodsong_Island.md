*The Bloodsong is what [Minotaurs](Minotaurs.md "wikilink") call the
sound the wind makes as it blows through the tunnels of this small
island. They claim it is the voice of [Tor](Tor.md "wikilink"), and it
makes them [stronger](Strength.md "wikilink"),
[tougher](Armor_Class.md "wikilink"), and far more
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink"). Outsiders are extremely
unwelcome. The island was once attached to [Paradise
Point](:Category:_Paradise_Point.md "wikilink"), but was blasted apart
from the mainland years ago to make it easier to conquer the more tame
[minotaurs](Minotaurs.md "wikilink") there. So far it hasn't helped.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

## Naviation

The area has three layers of similar sizes, of which the first two are
completely anti-magic. No rooms are cursed so recall/mercy at will.

## Adventuring

Bloodsong Island is a multi-level area that is near [Paradise
Point](:Category:_Paradise_Point.md "wikilink"). This area is a favorite
duo place for some [rogues](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink"), but you
should be warned that most of it is
[no-spell](Anti-Magic_Rooms.md "wikilink"). The
[portal](Portal.md "wikilink") point to the area is
[Nenba](Nenba_The_Archer.md "wikilink").  
*<Font color=red>Warning: Bloodlusters [eat
corpses](Corpse-Eating_Mobs.md "wikilink"), and other
[minotaurs](Minotaurs.md "wikilink") [can
stomp](:Category:_Stomping_Mobs.md "wikilink").</font>*

Most of the minotaurs cannot see move hidden. Also note that they are
berserkers, so you will hit less than normal.

## Affects

As of October 2011, the area features a tiny increase in experience
gains and a major increase in hp regen.
