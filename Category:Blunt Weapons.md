Blunt weapons do
[pounding](:Category:Melee_Weapons_That_Pound "wikilink"),
[crushing](:Category:Melee_Weapons_That_Crush "wikilink") or
[smacking](:Category:Melee_Weapons_That_Smack "wikilink") damage.  
Only [Berserkers](:Category:Berserkers "wikilink") get the [Blunt

useful for them.  
The max and average damage of a blunt weapon can be raised similar to
[sharpening](Sharpen "wikilink") by utilizing the
[rune](Rune "wikilink") spell.
