*Hidden away from prying eyes, the devil Bo'Vul keeps his money and toys
under lock and key. Those willing to pay the price and crafty enough to
get through the entrance have a chance to reap the rewards that lay
within.*

**Builder:** Ctibor

## Directions

Firstly, you need to buy the [Blood-Mithril
Key](Blood-Mithril_Key "wikilink") from [Bo'Vul](Bo'Vul "wikilink") to
get into the area. The key costs roughly 100k gold, but it can be
cleansed by a priest and copied by rogues (key copying toolkit required)
to cut down costs. Check if some kind soul has kept some in the pot in
Bandu's kitchen, or on the dwarf.

To get to vault, go e2d from [
Airscape](:Category:_Airscape.md "wikilink") shift. You'll see
[Tormak](Tormak "wikilink") there (scan desc: A wraithlike devil looks
bored). The room is full safe and noregen. Up from here leads back to [
Airscape Proper](:Category:_Airscape_Proper.md "wikilink").

Note that the area spans multiple planes.

## Navigation

To get into the vault, you have to figure out the timelock code hidden
in the sigils in the area north of the bank (also accessed using the key
from Bo'Vul). The bottom row represents the current time (EST). The
layout of the sigils apparently is a Kakuro puzzle.

If guessing the timelock code, you get it wrong, Tormak will kill you.
You don't lose any xp, but there's a very slight chance (maybe 5%) of
losing a stat. Note that you don't need to give the key to Tormak again,
until someone gets the code right.

Giving the key and the code (give the appropriate number of coins to
Tormak) will lead Tormak to ask you where in the Vault you want to go.
The possibilities are MERMEN (Only open late at night), IMAGERY (always
open), MENAGERIE (has to be unlocked by completing IMAGERY), GEARBOX
(has to be unlocked by completing MENAGERIE), and REPOSITORY (has to be
unlocked by completing GEARBOX). Tormak will eat the key and open the
vault for 60 secs. Go east and *enter pentagram*.

## Adventuring

Each area contains a different thief, which can be skinned for a ticket
for the [Vault Thief's Bane](Vault_Thief's_Bane "wikilink") quest.

### Imagery

The IMAGERY area is the only one available initially. You have to find
and kill Eremis (trackable). There are a lot of drifting mobs (Creatures
of Imagery) here, which also area spell. Group size: 12-15, with at
least 3-4 tanks and a good healer or two. There is various t2ish loot on
Eremis.

### Mermen

The MERMEN area is only available through Tormak from 11pm-11:59am? EST.
If anchor is set, you can plane into it 24/7. It's mostly underwater. It
has various t2-3 ac items (a -22 ac wield, a t2 ac chestplace, and
various other gear). The area is mostly linear. There are a couple of
Lloydable rooms here (including the first room and the room "Cold as
Ice"). Group size: 8+.

### Menagerie

The MENAGERIE area has various mobs from many different planes. Each
plane change is through an up/down exit. It's useful to drop coins at
up/down exits so that you don't backtrack by accident. You can type
**where** periodically to see in which plane you are. The final plane
you'll reach is Arcadia. Some of the mobs eat corpses (including some
who wander into the first room). I haven't found any stompers.

<spoiler text="Directions"> Each "plane" in the Menagerie is a bit of a
maze. Below are the directions to walk from one plane to the next.

Tarterus: e e n n e n n OR w n w  
Karnath: e n n u  
Nowhere: e s d  
Kzinti: e s s e d  
</spoiler>

At the end there is an animator deathwish in the [
Arcadian](:Category:_Arcadia.md "wikilink") plane. Killing the
deathwishes increases menagerie xp and opens the next area (GEARBOX).
There's a fair bit of area spells, and some mobs hit quite hard. Group
size: 12+

The "Arcadian Fire" room with 1w, 1u exit is an OK place to regenerate.

The Nothing level has ice hounds, who carry the ice collar and ice
hound's tooth items sometimes requested by Allegaagse.

### Gearbox

In the GEARBOX you have to find out the passphrase from the prisoner
near the beginning of the area and go through various gates. The
passphrase should ideally be said by a different class at each gate (can
be deduced by the name of the gate). If the wrong class says the
password, a few extra mobs spawn and perhaps they also hit harder.

The mechanical automatons drop bits which can be given to the gnome ws
from Thorngate Center for 100 xp.

More details on the password stuff: The first time the area is run after
a reboot, when you enter you'll see a mob prog like

`Cog in the Wheel`  
`[Exits: north west]`  
`(White Aura) A man is slowly being ground up between some gears.`

`Someone says - die -  to The unlucky adventurer.`  
`The unlucky adventurer's brain splatters onto the ground.`

`The unlucky adventurer whispers the word "citater fra"`

Collect the adventurer's corpse (it skins to an item which is this
section's, reboot-only, contribution to the
[Vault_Thief%27s_Bane](Vault_Thief%27s_Bane "wikilink") quest).

Remember that passphrase (in this case "citater fra", in another case
"rosebud") - you won't see it again on subsequent trips in the same
reboot but you may need it later on. The "gates" are mobs which are also
reboot-only that block further progress in the area.

If you're looking for steam guns; speak the incorrect password at the
bristling gate. The section after this gate and before the next gate
will have mobs with steam guns.

Be wary that a post-bristling-gate section has quite a few mobs who
carry bows and use lightning arrows; it's not unusual for 1 or 2 tanks
to be stunned for an entire fight and unable to interact at all with the
game until the fight is over. A mindbender can be very useful here for
decepting bows/arrows to prevent stun.

At the end, you'll see a gnome ([Unxavik](Unxavik "wikilink")) on scan,
which is a very unusual room. The room is nofight in the beginning. The
first person who enters will be abluted. If you send a tank in first,
they'll be abluted and then if you walk in as a leader, you'll be
abluted too. The gnome summons a couple of automata to help him. All hit
quite hard and the gnome can do various nifty things with his wand. Kill
the automata first and then deal with the gnome. Requires a fairly long
tank chain. Notable things he can do are (there is advance notice of
what it's going to do by the color):

-   Cast [death's door](Deaths_Door.md "wikilink") on the tank, which
    can reduce your tank's max hp to 1. Death's door can be cured with
    clarify. (color: black)
-   Cast detonate on the tank (color: yellow)
-   Make the room nospell (forgot the color)
-   Heal himself to full (forgot the color)

The gnome eventually runs out of mana. There is unusual loot on the
gnome, including a book worth 1k xp, which contains 6 pages (scrolls)
giving orbit, intervention, triple mass comfort, werrebocler, ablution
and spiritlink respectively.

One strategy for this room with 2 tanks:

-   Have one tank enter the room naked. That person will be abluted and
    combat will begin
-   Send the rest of the party
-   Respell the first tank.
-   Have casters surge 5 target Unxavik only - when he is dead the
    important part is over.
-   Mitigate the cool colored stuff you see. (Yellow emote means he will
    cast detonate on tank - so have naked person rescue. Black emote
    means he will cast deaths door on tank - so have a prs clarify &
    make sure no one heals.)

Group size: 15+, with a fair amount of tanks. It's good to have a prs
for clarify and a one or two det tanks.

### Repository

The REPOSITORY area has various gemstone themed mobs and gem tenders.
WARNING: Closing piles of gems causes mprogs to mess up. Which otherwise
contain Pgems --This was done intentionally so players have the choice
of closing piles to keep track of where they have looked at the expense
of possibly giving up future profits. Beware: some mobs in repository
scavenge. This can be bad for psi weapons. Group size: 10+.

The entire repository area is noregen or has greatly reduced regen --
the run is over when you're out of mana or hp.

There are also some special mobs (all are trackable):

-   Zlatan: fae, flees around, cannot be overconfidence-d, can be very
    rarely vs-kneed. He can be sniped in the knee by an assassin or
    fettered by a Stone Giant (STG) to prevent him from fleeing. He is
    the thief in this part of the vault, so his corpse can be skinned.
    He carries a demonic lapis lazuli (a special type of gem to craft
    special items). To see how to use the [demonic
    gem](Demonic_Lapis_Lazuli.md "wikilink"), go to the demonic crafter
    in the area north of the bank and type **LOOK MENU**.
-   Golem: spawns when you walk into the "Widow Tear Heart" room. Note
    that there are two hearts - "(Pink Aura) (Demonfire) The gem's
    purple light is focused towards the heart of the jewel." located in
    the "Widow Tear Fracture" room and "(Pink Aura) (Demonfire) The
    heart is lit up by purplish light refracted through the jewel."
    located in the "Widow Tear Heart" room. You can track heart and
    2.heart to get to the right one. The golem will be of different
    colors based on different gemstones. Killing the golem will either
    spawn a few money gems of appropriate type or spawn a perfect
    gemstone. Golems also have some loot, which is sometimes useful.
    Note that the diamond golem (if it spawns) is invisible. The emerald
    golem carries an [emerald shard](emerald_shard "wikilink"), a 14/14
    held item.
-   Dragons: can be skinned for treasure items (dragon statuettes). They
    use gas breath.
-   Mounds of topaz: can be immolated/astral prisoned.
-   Gem counters: These spawn when you spawn the golem (5 of them each
    time). They are non-aggie and wimpy, but can be overconfidence-d.
    Killing all of these will spawn one or more pgems and a demonic
    lapis lazuli in the piles of gems. The demonic lapis lazuli always
    spawns in a pile one room (north, south, east, west, down, or up)
    from the "Widow Tear Fracture" room with the "(Pink Aura)
    (Demonfire) The gem's purple light is focused towards the heart of
    the jewel." mob. The "Widow Tear Heart" room spawns the Golems and
    gem counters. Again, you can track heart and 2.heart to get to the
    right room. As a courtesy to future runners, try to kill the
    counters when you spawn the golem.

**Note**: Most areas have a fair bit of area spells and/or
wandering/drifting aggies, so taking a good healer or two with you is
useful.
