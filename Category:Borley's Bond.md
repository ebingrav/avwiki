''For centuries the proud Borley Mansion looked down over Ofcol, even
when it was little more than a northern farming village. The Borley
family was famed for their innate musical talent, and the farmers often
gather near the mansion simply to overhear the melodic sounds.

Sadly a dark curse fell upon the mansion and the turmoil within
eventually spawned this unholy relic within the outer planes. It may
appear the same as the original manor but an unusual evil is contained
within.''

The final room is much easier if you clear all the elemental reapers
first.
