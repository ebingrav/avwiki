Brandishes, or "brandies," are [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")
that may be both [worn](Wear "wikilink") and either
[brandished](Brandish "wikilink") or [zapped](Zap "wikilink"), namely
[staves](:Category:_Staves "wikilink") and
[wands](:Category:_Wands "wikilink").

Unlike with [potions](:Category:_Potions "wikilink") and
[pills](:Category:_Pills "wikilink"),
[spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") [cast](Cast "wikilink") using
these [objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") can or will
[affect](Affects "wikilink")
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") other than their user
(and, for [staves](:Category:_Staves "wikilink"), every
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") in their
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink")); and, unlike
[scrolls](:Category:_Scrolls "wikilink"), brandishes may (usually) be
used multiple times before being fully consumed. For these reasons, many
players may find brandishes to be rather handy during certain
circumstances. [Clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink"), for example,
may find them useful either for healing multiple groupmates
simultaneously without using their expensive mass-healing
[spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") or for continuing to heal their
tank even after their [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink") has been depleted.
And [characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") of other
[classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") may find them useful for
serving as supplemental or substitute [healers](Healers "wikilink") in
groups. Two important drawbacks of brandishes are that they may take
time to collect and that they can be very heavy.

See both [Staves](:Category:_Staves "wikilink") and
[Wands](:Category:_Wands "wikilink") below for more information about
individual brandishes.
