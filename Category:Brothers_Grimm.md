*There is a small house north of
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink") where two brothers named
Grimm live. They are master story-tellers, having travelled the Realm
over collecting its greatest tales. Children flock to their cottage from
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink") to hear their stories,
and adventurers flock there to learn from the Brothers, who have learned
much in the journeys.*

**Level Range:** 12-18

## Directions

Walking route from [Sol](Sol "wikilink"): 3e, s, 3e, 4s, e.

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [Brother
Grimm](Brother_Grimm "wikilink").

## Connections

## Navigation

Starting off, the area is divided into 5 directions from the brothers:

-   North is Cinderella, and her section. Nothing special here, besides
    wigs if you really want them.
-   South is Rapunzel and her section. Nothing special here, only a few
    mobs to kill
-   East is Hansel & Gretel's area, along with the big bad wolf. Odd
    maze in here, wander around and you'll eventually get back to where
    you started, or the wolf's house, or Hansel & Gretel.
-   Up are [aggie](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")
    [giants](Giants "wikilink"), leading to Brave Little Tailor, who has
    the [seven in one belt](Seven_In_One_Belt "wikilink")
    (+[str](Strength "wikilink")). Very useful to boost
    [hr](Hit_Roll "wikilink")/[dr](Damage_Roll "wikilink") till you've
    maxxed [strength](Strength "wikilink") (or get ogre gaunts) - which
    are grandfathered.
-   Lastly, Down brings you to the seven
    [AGGIE](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") dwarves. Be spelled when you
    come in here, or pray you dont die. If you get past them, you will
    be rewarded with [Snow White](Snow_White "wikilink") and her [tank
    gear neckpiece](Heart_Of_Gold "wikilink").

## Adventuring

A very fun area to run, especially if one likes the Brothers Grimm
stories. A good mix of good and evil mobs (which should be blatantly
apparent).
