*There is a small house north of
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink") where two brothers
named Grimm live. They are master story-tellers, having travelled the
Realm over collecting its greatest tales. Children flock to their
cottage from [Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink") to hear
their stories, and adventurers flock there to learn from the Brothers,
who have learned much in the journeys.*

Grimm](Brother_Grimm.md "wikilink").

## Connections

## Navigation

Starting off, the area is divided into 5 directions from the brothers:

-   North is Cinderella, and her section. Nothing special here, besides
    wigs if you really want them.
-   South is Rapunzel and her section. Nothing special here, only a few
    mobs to kill
-   East is Hansel & Gretel's area, along with the big bad wolf. Odd
    maze in here, wander around and you'll eventually get back to where
    you started, or the wolf's house, or Hansel & Gretel.
-   Up are [aggie](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink")
    [giants](Giants.md "wikilink"), leading to Brave Little Tailor, who
    has the [seven in one belt](Seven_In_One_Belt.md "wikilink")
    (+[str](Strength.md "wikilink")). Very useful to boost
    [hr](Hit_Roll.md "wikilink")/[dr](Damage_Roll.md "wikilink") till
    you've maxxed [strength](Strength.md "wikilink") (or get ogre
    gaunts) - which are grandfathered.
-   Lastly, Down brings you to the seven
    [AGGIE](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink") dwarves. Be spelled when you
    come in here, or pray you dont die. If you get past them, you will
    be rewarded with [Snow White](Snow_White.md "wikilink") and her
    [tank gear neckpiece](Heart_Of_Gold.md "wikilink").

## Adventuring

A very fun area to run, especially if one likes the Brothers Grimm
stories. A good mix of good and evil mobs (which should be blatantly
apparent).
