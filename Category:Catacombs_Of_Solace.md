*When settlers first came to the site that would become
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink"), they discovered a pit
filled with the ruins of an ancient temple. The townsfolk decided to use
the pit for the cellar of what would become the Inn of the Last Home,
but after seven townsfolk disappeared while working in the pit, the
attempt was abandoned and the Inn completed without a cellar. Some say
that the Inn only stands because an ancient statue to an unknown god was
left intact somewhere beneath the floorboards when the pit was filled
in.*
