*The walls toppled. The Golden Citadel melted and sunk. The streets
overturned as if they were but soil being tilled. Thus, [Tannah
Machadae](Tannah_Machadae "wikilink") obliterated the northern city of
[Ofcol](:Category:Ofcol "wikilink"), and from its ruins she raised her
own: Cathracharraig. The last of the survivors fleeing the doomed city
claim to have seen fortifications emerge fully formed from the
devastation, still smoldering with the heat of the earth. Whether or not
they are to be believed, it can be certain that Mistress Mach now lays
claim to her own kingdom: one in which her most loyal subjects are the
elements beneath her feet.*

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 20n

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [Troll Gate
Guard](Troll_Gate_Guard "wikilink") (entrance to the city),
[Mserie](Mserie "wikilink") (near the [Daingean
Machadae](:Category:Daingean_Machadae "wikilink")).

## Navigation

The area is divided into five sections:

-   Northwest - Crafts District
-   Northeast - Parade Grounds
-   Southwest - Mining Quarter
-   Southeast - City Garrison
-   Center - The Public House & City Entrance

Parts that "shouldn't" be poked by outsiders are cursed, the rest is
uncursed.

## Adventuring

Mobs vary from good 40s level mobs (various mercenaries and visitors to
the city) to very high hero-mobs (enormous golems and certain city
guards, like the Troll captain). Most are evil.

Wanton slaughter is not really recommended as the city **is** a
[lawful](Lawful_Flag "wikilink") town, and becoming an
[Outlaw](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink") here will mean Midgaard and other
lawful cities will also consider you as such.

Becoming outlaw will result in a stay in the city's dungeon. Unlike in
the Midgaard dungeon, there's no escape lever just for rogues.

Lawful mobs include:  
All the shopkeepers (they stay put in their shops), all the cityguards
(townguards who wander the city), the gate guards at the south entrance,
[Riscgnarl](Riscgnarl "wikilink") the troll captain of the guard, the
[Mining Captain](Mining_Captain "wikilink") (mining quarters, above the
mining shaft that leads down), the ogre guard right below the mining
captain (he is aggie; be hidden or invis!), the [Golem
Commander](Golem_Commander "wikilink") (a stout gray dwarf who assists
if you fight his pet), a [Deep Gnome
Surveyor](Deep_Gnome_Surveyor "wikilink") (wanders the cave beneath the
mining captain), [Tannah's executioner](Tannah's_executioner "wikilink")
(A dark glass golem), and jailer.
