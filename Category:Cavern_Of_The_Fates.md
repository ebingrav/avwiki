*Legend states that in [some forest](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink")
in the lands of Avatar the three Fates, [Clotho](Clotho.md "wikilink"),
[Lachesis](Lachesis.md "wikilink"), and
[Atropos](Atropos.md "wikilink"), have made their home. However, they
despise adventurers and visitors of all kinds, and have devised a trap
for any that may come their way. It is rumored that one can only escape
by defeating one of the Fates themselves.*

## Navigation

Starting from this area's entrance (from
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink")), the Gypsy is east while
the main area is south and then down.

The caverns are not recallable, so the only way out is either
teleport/portal or by murdering any of the Fates. In this regard, the
area is similar to the lower portion of [Greed's
Gallows](:Category:Greed's_Gallows.md "wikilink").

Navigating the caverns can be confusing due to many rooms with identical
or similar names, but the layout is fixed and the area is not a maze.

Three fountains exist that interconnect the cavern's passages, and three
more exist that lead to the Fates, and eventually outwards. The
fountains leading to Fates are marked as "Mysterious Fountains", so they
are easy to ignore, if the area is being run for experience.

## Adventuring

This area is big and fun to learn, it is scattered with various mobs. It
is designed around the [Fatewalkers
Quest](Fatewalkers_Quest "wikilink"), which includes killing all the
Fates, but it can easily be run for xp.

One big difficulty with this area is the fleeing mobs that can seriously
slow down a run. Basically there are four groups of mobs here:

-   The souls, the lost heros are weak easy low exp mobs that can be
    ignored if you want,
-   The Guardians of Fate are the wondering [aggie
    mobs](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink") that are good
    [exp](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") and dont
    [flee](Flee.md "wikilink"),
-   The three headed mobs wich are very good
    [exp](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") but
    [flee](Flee.md "wikilink") and
-   The three dragons in their lairs.

In this area you should generally wonder and kill, but make sure to kill
[aggies](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink") first and work your way down to
the others. Some groups may want to try to get
[fatewalkers](Fatewalkers.md "wikilink"), however, be wary not to
[quaff](Quaff.md "wikilink") the wrong
[fountain](Fountains.md "wikilink") (usually pools) because of the risk
of being sent to a another part of the caverns.

No mobs here are of exceeding difficulty or provide a real threat though
its advised for large groupies because this area can get swarmy and
troublesome for small groupies.

[Aggie Mobs](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink"): Guardians of Fate (Note:
these have various names i.e. guardian/warrior/defender but often will
only respond to guardian when targeted),
[Atropos](Atropos.md "wikilink"), [Lachesis](Lachesis.md "wikilink"),
[Clothos](Clothos.md "wikilink"), and three dragons.

Non-Aggie Mobs: Gypsy (though not in direct area is decent exp and
required for quest), Souls, Lost Hero, and Three-Headed mobs.
