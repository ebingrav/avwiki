*In times past, the battle between good and evil was not so one-sided as
it often seems today. Forces of Evil had great artifacts at their
disposal and used them to the dread of all. After a decisive victory,
some of these artifacts were destroyed. Others with magic too terrible
to undo were scattered throughout the realm and hidden well. [A great
wizard](Saliri.md "wikilink") has found the resting place of [one such
item](Evil_Crystal.md "wikilink") in a cavern deep in a mountainside.
Here [the wizard](Saliri.md "wikilink") has enlisted the help of deadly
beasts, enslaved by his will, to tap into [the
item](Evil_Crystal.md "wikilink")'s ancient power.*
