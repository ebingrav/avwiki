*Somewhere in the north of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") a
band of roving [centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") has made a hidden camp in
the ruins of an abandoned village. They help support the
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") who are fighting the deadly
Darklin scourge and are protecting one of
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s treasures.*

## Connections

Centaur Camp connects only to [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
to its southeast via a winding forest path.

## Navigation

Centaur Camp may be entered via a winding path that leads northwesterly
from [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s edge to a fallen
branch, which players can push or pull to gain access to an abandoned
village just north of it. This village consists of a few crumbling
buildings surrounding a small square, which
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") are trying to repair and to make
habitable. They are also growing food in a field to its west and
depositing waste in a middens to its southeast. A small trail leads
north from this village to a hidden glen where these
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") are protecting a baby unicorn. A
[map](Centaur_Camp_Map "wikilink") is available for this area as well.
