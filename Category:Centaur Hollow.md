*Rumors abound that, somewhere amidst the ancient oaks of southeastern
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink"), concealed safely within a
rock-encircled hollow long familiar only to
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink"), a [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink")
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink"), [Silvanus
Wayfinder](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink"), has been covertly gathering and
preparing a sylvan militia to eradicate
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s darklin infestation once
and for all. Some folks even claim that these would-be combatants have
begun to mysteriously vanish from this hollow without a trace, one by
one.*

## Connections

Centaur Hollow connects only with southeastern
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") via [Tari](Tari "wikilink")'s
glade to its north.

## Navigation

Centaur Hollow is almost entirely "[cursed](Cursed_Rooms "wikilink")"
and, as a result, may be entered only by going southward through a
(camouflaged) gate in a thicket (a "[safe room](Safe_Rooms "wikilink")"
where [Konk](Konk "wikilink") [stands](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink")). This
leads through a narrow gap between the rocks to the northeast corner of
a large central hollow ringed by granite walls. This hollow also
connects to a mossy amphitheater to its east, a bell-shaped grotto to
its southeast, a ferny glen (that leads to a hidden cavity) to its
southwest, a verdant cavern to its west, and an alcove containing a
[mineral spring](Fountains "wikilink") (which [casts](Cast "wikilink")
'[acumen](Acumen "wikilink")' on its drinkers) to its northwest. Various
[level](Level "wikilink")-20 [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"),
including [centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink"), [ents](Ents "wikilink"),
[lizardmen](Lizardmen "wikilink"), [sprites](Sprites "wikilink"), and
even a [high-elf](High_Elves "wikilink") and her
[elven](Elves "wikilink") son, either [stand](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink")
in these spots or [wander](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink") about them.

## Adventuring

No [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") here are
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") (although they may [assist each
other](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink")) and, so, this
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") is *very* safe to explore. It is
also relatively rich with descriptions to read, some of which are vital
for those players who are interested in solving its mystery regarding
why its fighters have been vanishing.

There are three minor [ticket
quests](:Category:_Ticket_Quests "wikilink") here, two of which are
connected with solving this area's mystery. Each of these
[quests](:Category:_Ticket_Quests "wikilink") will reward
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") who complete them with a
different [special piece of
gear](:Category:_Ticket_Quest_Rewards "wikilink"). See [Quests In
Centaur Hollow](:Category:_Quests_In_Centaur_Hollow "wikilink") (also
listed below) for more information about each of these three [ticket
quests](:Category:_Ticket_Quests "wikilink").

Players interested in fighting here should note that nearly all
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") here have positive
[alignment](Alignment "wikilink"); and, so, those who would like to gain
[experience](Experience_Points "wikilink") here but who are concerned
with maintaining a positive [alignment](Alignment "wikilink") themselves
may wish to spend some time fighting either in adjoining
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") or in nearby [Darklin
Hole](:Category:_Darklin_Hole "wikilink"), as well, as needed. All
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") here are [level](Level "wikilink") 20
but some may be a bit more difficult to kill than others.
[Sprites](Sprites "wikilink") here will show "special" behavior (like
[spellcasting](Spellcasting_Mobs "wikilink")) during combat.
