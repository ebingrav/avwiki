*Somewhere in the north of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")
a band of roving [centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") has made a hidden
camp in the ruins of an abandoned village. They help support the
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers.md "wikilink") who are fighting the deadly
Darklin scourge and are protecting one of
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s treasures.*

## Connections

Centaur Camp connects only to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") to its southeast via a
winding forest path.

## Navigation

Centaur Camp may be entered via a winding path that leads northwesterly
from [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s edge to a fallen
branch, which players can push or pull to gain access to an abandoned
village just north of it. This village consists of a few crumbling
buildings surrounding a small square, which
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") are trying to repair and to make
habitable. They are also growing food in a field to its west and
depositing waste in a middens to its southeast. A small trail leads
north from this village to a hidden glen where these
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") are protecting a baby unicorn. A
[map](Centaur_Camp_Map.md "wikilink") is available for this area as
well.
