*Rumors abound that, somewhere amidst the ancient oaks of southeastern
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink"), concealed safely within a
rock-encircled hollow long familiar only to
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink"), a [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers.md "wikilink"), [Silvanus
Wayfinder](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink"), has been covertly gathering
and preparing a sylvan militia to eradicate
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s darklin infestation once
and for all. Some folks even claim that these would-be combatants have
begun to mysteriously vanish from this hollow without a trace, one by
one.*

## Connections

Centaur Hollow connects only with southeastern
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") via
[Tari](Tari.md "wikilink")'s glade to its north.

## Navigation

Centaur Hollow is almost entirely "[cursed](Cursed_Rooms.md "wikilink")"
and, as a result, may be entered only by going southward through a
(camouflaged) gate in a thicket (a "[safe
room](Safe_Rooms.md "wikilink")" where [Konk](Konk.md "wikilink")
[stands](Sentinel_Mobs.md "wikilink")). This leads through a narrow gap
between the rocks to the northeast corner of a large central hollow
ringed by granite walls. This hollow also connects to a mossy
amphitheater to its east, a bell-shaped grotto to its southeast, a ferny
glen (that leads to a hidden cavity) to its southwest, a verdant cavern
to its west, and an alcove containing a [mineral
spring](Fountains.md "wikilink") (which [casts](Cast.md "wikilink")
'[acumen](Acumen.md "wikilink")' on its drinkers) to its northwest.
Various [level](Level.md "wikilink")-20
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"), including
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink"), [ents](Ents.md "wikilink"),
[lizardmen](Lizardmen.md "wikilink"), [sprites](Sprites.md "wikilink"),
and even a [high-elf](High_Elves.md "wikilink") and her
[elven](Elves.md "wikilink") son, either
[stand](Sentinel_Mobs.md "wikilink") in these spots or
[wander](Wandering_Mobs.md "wikilink") about them.

## Adventuring

No [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") here are
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink") (although they may [assist
each other](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink")) and, so, this
[area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") is *very* safe to explore. It is
also relatively rich with descriptions to read, some of which are vital
for those players who are interested in solving its mystery regarding
why its fighters have been vanishing.

There are three minor [ticket
quests](:Category:_Ticket_Quests.md "wikilink") here, two of which are
connected with solving this area's mystery. Each of these
[quests](:Category:_Ticket_Quests.md "wikilink") will reward
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") who complete them with
a different [special piece of
gear](:Category:_Ticket_Quest_Rewards.md "wikilink"). See [Quests In
Centaur Hollow](:Category:_Quests_In_Centaur_Hollow.md "wikilink") (also
listed below) for more information about each of these three [ticket
quests](:Category:_Ticket_Quests.md "wikilink").

Players interested in fighting here should note that nearly all
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") here have positive
[alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink"); and, so, those who would like to
gain [experience](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") here but who are
concerned with maintaining a positive
[alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink") themselves may wish to spend some
time fighting either in adjoining
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") or in nearby [Darklin
Hole](:Category:_Darklin_Hole.md "wikilink"), as well, as needed. All
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") here are
[level](Level.md "wikilink") 20 but some may be a bit more difficult to
kill than others. [Sprites](Sprites.md "wikilink") here will show
"special" behavior (like
[spellcasting](Spellcasting_Mobs.md "wikilink")) during combat.
