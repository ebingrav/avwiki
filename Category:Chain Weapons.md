Chain weapons are necessarily two handed. Using a chained weapon gives
you the following advantages:

-   You can [Double Hit](Double_Hit "wikilink"), doubling your number of
    attacks.
-   You can use [Whirlwind](Whirlwind "wikilink"): a melee area attack.
-   They also improve your success with [Disarm](Disarm "wikilink").

Chain weapons are generally sharpenable.  
It is worth noting that you cannot [Double
Parry](Double_Parry "wikilink") with a chain weapon, and that you cannot
[Riposte](Riposte "wikilink"). Therefore, they are not an ideal weapon
for soloing.
