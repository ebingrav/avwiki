''When one normally thinks of a Dragon, they may imagine a powerful,
fire-breathing, reptilian creature. While this description is often apt,
other types of Dragons also exist in our Realm:

*The shadowy [Black Dragons](Black_Dragons "wikilink")  
*The [Blue Dragons](Blue_Dragons "wikilink") of the Ocean  
*The venomous [Green Dragons](Green_Dragons "wikilink")  
*The [White Dragons](White_Dragons "wikilink") of the Frozen North

''Despite the differences between the Dragon subraces, they share many
similarities. They are all huge creatures that are physically powerful
and magically gifted. They all also share certain racial abilities. All
Dragons have use of their distinctive breath, claw, and tail attacks in
combat. Likewise, all Dragons are protected by dense scales. Dragons can
regain small amounts of health by eating corpses, and their powerful,
leathery wings allow them to fly.

''It is told that Quixoltan occasionally honors a valiant Dragon by
allowing them to change their Chromatic alignment. Those in search of
such glory should make a pilgrimage to his temple.
