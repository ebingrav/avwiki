*A war waged, a culture lost.*

*Imix's unquenchable flames consumed everything. The land, its people,
and their history. Not even the true name of this place survives.*

*Interplanar voyagers call it Cinderheim. Death came swiftly for the
lucky. Those who dared to resist suffered a far worse fate: surviving to
watch helplessly as their homeworld was pulled into the influence of the
all-consuming flames.*

*Nothing remains of this place but ash and smoke. Anyone that dwells in
such an inhospitable environment must have a strong will to survive.*

**Builder**: Mimir

## Directions

From fire shift, go **2n,u** or **e,n,u** or **s,e,u** to reach the
first room in Cinderheim. This room is a semi-safe room - the roasting
carcass isn't aggressive. Rarely, however, the group of 4 will walk into
this room.

## Connections

## Navigation

After the initial few rooms, the linear path leads up. This is the
Cinderheim proper - a 7x5 mesh with some missing interconnecting lines.
From the first room of this mesh, the shortest way towards Dragon is s,
3e, s, 2u. To reach the gear portion of Cinderheim, from the same room
walk 2n, 2w, 2s, d.

## Adventuring

Cinderheim is a nice area to gain experience in. None of the mobs cast
spells, but there are a few mobs ([Noxious
Smoke](Noxious_Smoke "wikilink"), on scan as a sickly cloud) which gas.
Mob levels vary roughly between 170 and 200. It's a good idea to take a
healer with you.  
The entire area is cursed.  
There are four relatively tough mobiles (Edmund, Ralthar, Rapini, and
Lanorth) wandering the first four rooms after the roasting carcass. Two
avenging angels spawn after two of the mobs have been killed, giving you
a total six possible mobs in a room. Rapini likes to bash, so you will
need to switch tanks and watch their health.  
[A dusty tome of forgotten
lore](Dusty_Tome_Of_Forgotten_Lore "wikilink") and the [Stiletto
"Poignant Memories"](Stiletto_"Poignant_Memories" "wikilink") can be
retreived by killing [He Who Remembers](He_Who_Remembers "wikilink").

There is a lloydable room ([the peak of the
precipice](Peak_Of_The_Precipice "wikilink")) with a big sentinel mob
([Majestic Dragon](Majestic_Dragon "wikilink")) on the spire accessible
from the Mesa rooms (keep an eye out for the grey forms listlessly
scanning - these are Mesa Sentinels) then search for an Up from one of
those rooms. There is a crater in the Lloydable room, drinking from
which gives sanc to evil chars and poisons good chars.

In order to reach the gear section, follow the lava-filled fissure until
you find the other down exit (the first down exit being the one you
entered the area through). Alternatively, look at the map and navigate
it. From here, there is a door north, then a scarab and 3 carcasses in a
three room east-west loop, kill all three carcasses to spawn the grim
sentry. This mob will then have the key to open the inner sanctum, north
from where the sentry spawns. Inside there you will find He Who
Remembers and four hulking mummies in a 3 room east-west loop.
