*Reports have come in from the wildwood about a strange citadel on a
cliff, and the unliving servants that keep it running. Some rumours say
that odd students study the teachings of a cult there, seeking to
perfect some new arcane craft. Other, wilder stories suggest that all is
not as it seems, and that some people have started to... disappear. It
seems one would have to be foolish, or nigh heroic, to seek the truth of
the matter.*

## Connections

The area is located off of the
[Wildwood](:Category:Wildwood.md "wikilink") in the southeast corner.

## Navigation

The main ground level of the area is a courtyard laid out generally in
an "L" shape, with the main entrance along the side of the "L". The more
interesting parts of the area are above and below ground. The area below
is pretty much a straight east to west line with a few ups and down and
rooms off the main path. There is a tower to the northwest and a tower
to the east. A shack in the north is where a bunch of in-repair
constructs are. There are two entrances to underground, in the southeast
and southwest ends of the "L".

## Adventuring

This area can be good for high low mort groups or low hero group runs.
The more numerous mobs in the court yard area, various kinds of
homunculus, provide plenty of easy to reach experience, but care must be
taken to watch out for hero level mobs. The servitors, lower level
students and more advanced initiates provide experience for stronger
groups or low level heroes. The lower level mobs (students and
constructs) may flee.

The are a few higher level mobs with gear, but they are spread out and
do not generally make for an upper level experience run, although they
can provide good sources of solo experience. There are several quests in
the area that involve the higher level mobs. Not until later in the
quests do the mobs get [aggie](Aggressive.md "wikilink"). The masters
are higher levels and may cast. There is a variety of usable
[mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink"), [stat
gear](:Category:Level_Gear.md "wikilink") and affects gear here, but
nothing top tier. There is even a [sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink")
[staff](Charred_Pentagram_Amulet.md "wikilink") for evil types here.

It looks like homunculi are level 45, students are level 50, and
initiates are level 55 -- all good choices for low-40s experience.
