*A class definer is a [spell or
skill](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") which only that
[class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") receives. The in-game reason
can be described as a trade secret. The code reason is that every
[class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") should and does have unique
abilities separate from the other classes. Unlike CD's, other [skills
and spells](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") typically are
available for all [classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink")
eventually.*
