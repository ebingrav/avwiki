*Originally, there was only one caste of clerics. They were formed under
the goddess of [Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith.md "wikilink"). With her as their
guide, clerics stretched far and wide healing the sick and wounded and
protecting all from danger with their clerical spells.*

*The [prime requisite](Prime_Requisite.md "wikilink") of Clerics is
[WISdom](Wisdom.md "wikilink"). They are specialists in
[healing](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Heal_Characters.md "wikilink")
[hit points](Hit_Points.md "wikilink"), creating [protective
spells](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Buff_Characters.md "wikilink"),
and many clerical [enchantments](Enchanting.md "wikilink"). Unlike in
the past, they can now worship any of the
[pantheon](Worship.md "wikilink").*

**Abbreviation:** Cle.

**[Prime Requisite](Prime_Requisite.md "wikilink"):**
[Wisdom](Wisdom.md "wikilink").

## Clerics in General

Clerics specialize in casting both
[curative](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Heal_Characters.md "wikilink")
and
[protective](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Buff_Characters.md "wikilink")
spells and are the only creatable class that does this. Because of this,
this is the class to pick when creating a healer.

Because the popular cleric deities [Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith "wikilink") and
[Kra](Kra "wikilink") improve their worshippers'
[armor](Armor_Class.md "wikilink") buffing spells, clerics who
[worship](Worship.md "wikilink") them may find their spells in great
demand.

## Cleric Creation

Any [race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") may be a cleric but some
races are better suited for clericry than others. Although the prime
requisite of clerics is [Wisdom](Wisdom "wikilink"), it's not really
important, since clerics of all races will have enough practice points.
Since clerics are spellcasters, races which make good casters (mages for
instance) will also make good clerics. Good creatable races are
[Centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink"), [Gnomes](Gnomes "wikilink"),
[Elves](Elves "wikilink") and [Drow](Drow "wikilink").
[Lizardmen](Lizardmen "wikilink") are also a good option for remorting
into [Tuataurs](Tuataurs "wikilink"). Conversely, races with low
[intelligence](Intelligence.md "wikilink"), such as
[gargoyles](Gargoyles.md "wikilink"), [giants](Giants.md "wikilink"),
and [kobolds](Kobolds.md "wikilink"), tend to be poor clerics with high
rates of spellcasting failure.

Some races with subhuman intelligence such as
[Dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") and [Duergar](Duergar "wikilink") actually
do make decent clerics and have bonuses to the spellcosts of divine
spells, even if they do make poor mages and sometimes fail spells.
[Ents](Ents "wikilink") also have a casting bonus for divine spells.

Another factor which may influence the choice of race for cleric is how
your race will react with the [pantheon
spells](:Category:_Pantheon_Spells.md "wikilink"), whose effects range
from damage resistance, to boosting group damage, to boosting one's own
healing powers.

## Clerics at Lowmort Tier

### Training

As with any new character, train [Wisdom](Wisdom "wikilink") first,
followed by [Intelligence](Intelligence "wikilink") and
[Constitution](Constitution "wikilink"). Since clerics have the most
learnable skills out of all classes, it's especially important to make
the most of your practices. Note that intelligence doesn't affect a
cleric's healing or buffing spells, it will only affect mana gains and
the number of practices needed to adept skills.

Each point of [Strength](Strength "wikilink") will increase carry
capacity, and add a point of [Hit Roll](Hit_Roll "wikilink") and [Damage
Roll](Damage_Roll "wikilink"), but it won't do anything special for a
cleric's skills or spells. Likewise, each point of
[Dexterity](Dexterity "wikilink") will increase inventory capacity and
add -10 [Armor Class](Armor_Class "wikilink"), but will not affect a
cleric in any other way.

### Practicing

Clerics learn a wide assortment of spells with a web of prerequisites,
so it's easy to get sidetracked while practicing and end up without
enough practice points to learn your important skills. Be sure to keep
enough practice points to get the following skills:

-   All of your healing spells [Cure Light](Cure_Light "wikilink"),
    [Cure Serious](Cure_Serious "wikilink"), [Cure
    Critical](Cure_Critical "wikilink"), [Heal](Heal "wikilink"),
    [Divinity](Divinity "wikilink")
-   The curative spells [Cure Blindness](Cure_Blindness "wikilink"),
    [Cure Poison](Cure_Poison "wikilink"), and [Cure
    Disease](Cure_Disease "wikilink")
-   [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") and its many prerequisites [Detect
    Evil](Detect_Evil "wikilink"), [Detect
    Alignment](Detect_Alignment "wikilink"), [Protection
    Good](Protection_Good "wikilink") and [Protection
    Evil](Protection_Evil "wikilink")
-   [Frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink") will be cast on hitters, and is used at
    all tiers
-   [Water Breathing](Water_Breathing "wikilink") you can do without
    until you can't do without it, and then you'll drown and die. So
    don't do without it.
-   [Arcane Knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge "wikilink") will allow you to
    use [wands](:Category:Wands.md "wikilink") and
    [staves](:Category:Staves.md "wikilink") to cast spells without
    using your mana
-   [Calm](Calm "wikilink") allows you or your group to escape combat if
    needed.
-   [Remove Curse](Remove_Curse "wikilink") is always useful if you are
    cursed and can't recall, or if you are stuck holding cursed gear.
-   [Portal](Portal "wikilink") makes group travel quick and easy

Some spells you can forgo include:

-   [Flamestrike](Flamestrike "wikilink") is a level 15 damage spell
    which doesn't have much use, since it isn't a prerequisite for
    anything else.
-   [Turn Undead](Turn_Undead "wikilink") and [Turn
    Demon](Turn_Demon "wikilink") rarely work as well as you might like.
-   [Dispel Evil](Dispel_Evil "wikilink") actually does good damage for
    its very small mana cost, but it's hardly important.

Other spells such as [Pass Door](Pass_Door "wikilink"), [Locate
Object](Locate_Object "wikilink"), and [Earthbind](Earthbind "wikilink")
are useful if you have the practice points to spare, but are not
critical. Debuffs like [Blindness](Blindness "wikilink") and [Faerie
Fire](Faerie_Fire "wikilink") are useful at low levels, but lose their
effectiveness (technically, they just get harder to apply to mobs) at
higher levels, such as level 35 and onward.

To make the most of your abilities, practice healing spells such as
[Cure Light](Cure_Light "wikilink") or [Heal](Heal "wikilink") as soon
as you are able. [Cure Light](Cure_Light "wikilink") heals 25 hit
points, [Cure Serious](Cure_Serious "wikilink") heals 50, [Cure
Critical](Cure_Critical "wikilink") heals 75, [Heal](Heal "wikilink")
heals 125, and [Divinity](Divinity "wikilink") heals 250. The most
efficient uses of mana are cure light, heal, and divinity. Cure critical
is slightly less efficient, and cure serious is the least efficient.

Mass healing spells are of a lower priority than single target healing
spells. In general, if you need to heal the entire room, you should use
[Arcane Knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge "wikilink") to brandish a healing
[staff](:Category:Staves.md "wikilink") such as the [Shard Of
Durrite](Shard_Of_Durrite "wikilink") or [Gold Dragon
Orb](Gold_Dragon_Orb "wikilink"). Even though a cleric's own spells will
heal more than a wand or staff, a mass spell costs about 3.5 times as
much as a normal one, whereas brandishing costs nothing, and the lag is
similar as well. Learn them as prerequisites for [Mass
Heal](Mass_Heal "wikilink") and [Mass
Divinity](Mass_Divinity "wikilink") but don't feel required to learn
them as soon as possible.

Attack spells such as [Cause Light](Cause_Light "wikilink"),
[Harm](Harm "wikilink"), and [Earthquake](Earthquake "wikilink") are of
questionable usefulness. They are good if you find yourself soloing, but
in groups a cleric will never be called upon to stop healing and start
casting damage spells.

### Worshipping

[Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith "wikilink") and [Kra](Kra "wikilink") are the two
most popular deities that clerics worship, while [Gorn](Gorn "wikilink")
and [Roixa](Roixa "wikilink") are less popular alternatives. With the
addition of [Pantheon Spells](:Category:_Pantheon_Spells.md "wikilink"),
further options are available for clerics who wish to persue other
choices for worship. Peruse the [worship table](Worship.md "wikilink")
for the full breakdown.

**Kra versus Tul-Sith:** Both of these goddesses improve the power of a
cleric's healing spells, and the power of their [Armor
Class](Armor_Class "wikilink") buffing spells. Tul-Sith has stronger
healing spells, while Kra's protective spells are more potent. Kra will
also improve melee damage (which is something to consider if your cleric
is a strong race such as [Dwarf](Dwarf "wikilink"),
[Centaur](Centaur "wikilink"), or [Ent](Ent "wikilink")) while Tul-Sith
will worsen melee damage and make spells last a slightly shorter amount
of time. Tul-Sith will vastly improve mana and hit point regeneration,
while Kra will worsen regeneration slightly. Both Kra and Tul-Sith
worsen spell damage.

**Roixa:** Roixa is typically only worshiped if a cleric wishes to
become a [Druid](:Category:Druids.md "wikilink"). She improves healing
spells very slightly, but decreases [Armor
Class](Armor_Class "wikilink") buffing spells significantly. Roixa also
improves archery damage the most out of any god, but that only applies
after a cleric has become a druid, so she offers very little for
ordinary clerics.

**Gorn:** Gorn is usually worshiped by monks, but also offers some
benefits to healers. He improves healing spells by about 10%, though
their mana cost also increases. Gorn's most significant effect is his
[Armor Class](Armor_Class "wikilink") buffing spells, which are the best
available; however they are also the shortest lasting spells. Clerics
who want a slightly more relaxed experience usually opt to worship Kra,
though Gorn [Frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink") is always a nice thing to have
cast on oneself.

### Fighting

Like other [classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink"), lowmort clerics
should have little trouble soloing from level 1 to level 20 very
quickly. Afterward, gaining
[experience](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") alone will grow
increasingly difficult and clerics should seriously consider grouping.

**Soloing:** Clerics are not well-suited for soloing and will likely
find this terribly challenging. Get a mix of tank and hit gear, then use
a combination of healing and attack spells. After level 30 or so, this
will be difficult for a cleric.

**Tanking:** If a cleric tanks, they will need a set of [tank
gear](:Category:Tank_Gear.md "wikilink"). A tanking cleric can serve as
their own healer, which opens up an extra group slot for another hitter,
but avoid relying on brandishes for healing. They lag twice as much as
casting healing spells, which will result in a slow paced run.

**Hitting:** Clerics aren't grouped for their hitting, simply put. Even
if a god such as [Kra](Kra "wikilink") improves melee damage, it won't
make them good hitters at lowmort, and cleric damage spells have
basically no use outside of soloing.

**Healing:** Clerics usually serve as [healers](Healers.md "wikilink")
in groups. Clerics should wear [mana
gear](:Category:_Mana_Gear.md "wikilink") to maximize their available
mana for healing. Clerics can also use
[staves](:Category:Staves.md "wikilink") to cast healing spells on the
entire room without spending mana. This is generally preferable to
casting a mass healing spell, because of their higher spell costs.

The three most efficient healing spells are [Cure
Light](Cure_Light "wikilink"), [Heal](Heal "wikilink"), and
[Divinity](Divinity "wikilink"), followed by [Cure
Critical](Cure_Critical "wikilink") and trailed by [Cure
Serious](Cure_Serious "wikilink"). Wands and Staves heal less than if
cast naturally, and lag twice as much, but don't carry any spell cost at
all.

Clerics are usually responsible for keeping
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") and [Frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink")
applied to the group, but since it costs so much to cast sanctuary
repeatedly, the [White Marble Cross](White_Marble_Cross "wikilink") is
frequently used to sanc the entire room (and as such, sanctuary duty can
fall to anyone with [Arcane Knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge "wikilink"), not
just the healer).

Lastly, be sure to stick a monitor in your [Prompt](Prompt "wikilink")
so that you can monitor a groupmate's hit points, for example **%u:
%w/%Whp** might show up as **SoAndSo: 655/700hp**.

## Cleric Prestige Options

[Level](Level.md "wikilink")-50 clerics may choose to become
[druids](:Category:_Druids.md "wikilink") instead. As
[druids](:Category:_Druids.md "wikilink"), they will
[wield](Wield.md "wikilink") [missile
weapons](:Category:_Missile_Weapons.md "wikilink") like
[archers](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink") rather than [melee
weapons](:Category:_Melee_Weapons.md "wikilink"). See
[Druids](:Category:_Druids.md "wikilink") for more information about
this [prestige class](:Category:_Prestige_Classes.md "wikilink").

Alternatively, a level 50 cleric may choose to become a
[Vizier](:Category:Viziers.md "wikilink").

## Clerics at Hero Tier

### Training

At hero, your maximum [Wisdom](Wisdom "wikilink") will increase by 5,
while your other traits will increase by 2. Intelligence still has no
effect on spells, outside of mana regeneration and mana gains at level,
and Wisdom still has no effect outside of practice point gains at level.

### Practicing

The important skills to practice are roughly the same as any other hero
caster:

-   [Rescue](Rescue "wikilink") is one of those skills that you only
    realize you need after you're in trouble, so practice it and be done
    with it.
-   [Dodge](Dodge "wikilink"), [Parry](Parry "wikilink"), and [Shield
    Block](Shield_Block "wikilink") significantly increase your
    survivability
-   [Sneak](Sneak "wikilink") and [Move Hidden](Move_Hidden "wikilink")
    increase your survivability as well
-   [Second Attack](Second_Attack "wikilink"), [Third
    Attack](Third_Attack "wikilink"), [Enhanced
    Damage](Enhanced_Damage "wikilink"), and [Bash](Bash "wikilink")
    won't make you a hitter, but they are always useful both for soloing
    and being the best you can be in a group
-   [Teleport](Teleport "wikilink") is always useful
-   [Acumen](Acumen "wikilink") boosts wisdom by 4! Don't miss it.

On the other hand, do not bother learning any out-of-class damage
spells. Even if cleric attack spells are bad, out-of-class ones are bad
and have extra lag to boot.

If you find yourself running low on move points as a low hero, consider
practicing [Endurance](Endurance "wikilink") and casting it before
leaving for a run.

### Fighting

Clerics at [hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink")
[tier](:Category:_Tiers.md "wikilink"), as at
[lowmort](:Category:_Lowmort.md "wikilink")
[tier](:Category:_Tiers.md "wikilink"), continue to be well-suited and
oft-wanted to serve as group [healers](Healers.md "wikilink"). Some
[hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") clerics may wish to increase their
versatility by learning to [tank](Tanks.md "wikilink") groups, as well,
which becomes easier for clerics to do at this
[tier](:Category:_Tiers.md "wikilink").

**Soloing:** Clerics are not well-suited for soloing and will likely
find this terribly challenging.

**Tanking:** This will be much easier once you have learned
[Dodge](Dodge "wikilink"), [Parry](Parry "wikilink"), and [Shield
Block](Shield_Block "wikilink"). A cleric makes a good tank because they
are their own healer, though it might be wise to ask other groupmates to
rescue and [sanc](Sanctuary.md "wikilink") the group, simply to keep the
group leader out of lag as much as possible.

**Hitting:** Clerics are not grouped as hitters, end of story. Good [hit
gear](:Category:Hero_Hit_Gear.md "wikilink") as well as worshiping Kra
will improve melee damage, but that is more of a pleasant side effect,
rather than a reason for being grouped. By all means practice [Second
Attack](Second_Attack "wikilink"), [Third
Attack](Third_Attack "wikilink"), [Enhanced
Damage](Enhanced_Damage "wikilink"), and [Bash](Bash "wikilink") to make
the most of your melee abilities, though. Don't waste mana casting
attack spells.

**Healing:** [Heal](Heal "wikilink") and [Divinity](Divinity "wikilink")
are the best tools a cleric can bring to a group. Remember they are the
most efficient healing spells (along side [Cure
Light](Cure_Light "wikilink")) so avoid cure critical and cure serious.
Reserve [Mass Divinity](Mass_Divinity "wikilink") for emergencies, and
keep a large number of healing [staves](:Category:Staves.md "wikilink")
on hand to conserve mana. [Typhus
Staves](Black_Staff_Of_Typhus.md "wikilink") are the best for this, but
[Emerald Sceptres of Light](Emerald_Sceptre_Of_Light.md "wikilink"),
[Sceptres of Growing Roots](Sceptre_Of_Growing_Roots.md "wikilink"), and
[Gold Dragon Orbs](Gold_Dragon_Orb.md "wikilink") are good alternatives.
Also consider double-heal scrolls, such as the [Crumbling
Scroll](Crumbling_Scroll "wikilink"). They are only single target, but
are twice as potent as a brandish of a healing staff. Use [White Marble
Crosses](White_Marble_Cross.md "wikilink") and [Pearl-Tipped
Staves](Pearl-Tipped_Staff.md "wikilink") to cast sanctuary on the
entire room, which saves quite a bit of mana when you have 4+ in a
group.

## Clerics at Lord Tier

Clerics get a lot more hp than mages but significantly worse mana at
lord. Unlike at hero, the spell [Comfort](Comfort "wikilink") is
affected by having high [Wisdom](Wisdom "wikilink"), though not by a
lot. [Mass Comfort](Mass_Comfort "wikilink") is more efficient when
healing 4 or more group mates. (Pay attention to the messages
"So-And-So's wounds are greatly healed" vs "So-And-So is completely
healed" to keep track of how many people in the group actually need
healing.) Also use [Saving Grace](Saving_Grace "wikilink") to easily
swap monitor targets.

To conserve mana, try to maintain a good pacing for heals (this can only
be learned by experience unfortunately) and don't worry about keeping
every tank at full or even 75% health unless you are in an extremely
dangerous area. Assume that the group will stop to regen once during the
run, but ask when in doubt. [Light Of Hope](Light_Of_Hope "wikilink") is
unfortunately a terrible mana-regenerating spell; cast it as soon as the
group has taken appreciable damage, and after that as early and often as
possible, but don't expect much from it.

Clerics also get [Spiritlink](Spiritlink "wikilink") which can be useful
when running det gear.

If while spelling up for a run, you see a psion ask a mage or wizard for
an air hammer, be a dear and cast [Remove
Curse](Remove_Curse "wikilink") on the mage. If you are grouped with a
priest, pay extra attention to the health of evil characters like
Sorcerers and Demonseeds, as priests can't heal them very well.

## Cleric Remort Options

The remort options for cleric are
[Priest](:Category:Priests.md "wikilink") at Lord 100 and
[Paladin](:Category:Paladins.md "wikilink") at Lord 150 (doubled to keep
your current race). Priests have significantly more mana than clerics
and excel at healing the entire room, while Paladins are their own thing
that can't be summed up in a single sentence, so just read their page
instead.

Remort races that suit clerics are any that suit mages or any other
caster - [Sprites](Sprites "wikilink"), [High
Elves](High_Elves "wikilink"), [Tuataurs](Tuataurs "wikilink"), etc.

[Category: Core Classes](Category:_Core_Classes "wikilink")
