*In the western parts of [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink"),
very near the [Great Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"),
there is a crescent-shaped gully into which a large amount of rainwater
flows from the surrounding region. Over the years, this has turned the
gully into a murky swamp. A large number of [Lizard
Folk](Lizardmen "wikilink"), clad in black and silver armor, have been
rumored to have been traveling to the Bog in the last week or so.*
