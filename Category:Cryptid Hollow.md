*The vast Midgaardian landscape is dotted with a myriad of dark corners
and forgotten places. In those places are known to reside long-hidden
creatures and ancient artifacts that very few see with their own eyes...
and live to tell the tale. One such location is rumored to exist just
beyond [Igecsoz](:Category:_Igecsoz "wikilink"), long disregarded by the
[trogolodyte](Troglodytes "wikilink") populous.*

## Adventuring

This area looks to be a fair place to level in the suggested level
range. The [Irksome Insects](Irksome_Insect "wikilink") are
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), but they are only level 7, so
they just serve as an annoyance. One of them carries the
[Exoskeleton](Exoskeleton "wikilink"), a rare psi-buff for those classes
unable to pull full [Fortitudes](Fortitudes "wikilink") at
[UD](:Category:Hero_Quest "wikilink").

The lower levels are cursed, and have [aggressive
mobs](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") that are of the suggested level range,
so be careful. There is also some good gear on the mobs at the end of
the lower level, but they are affected by
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") and carrying wields, so they are
difficult to kill.

The area was revised by retro team to include
[Ssithtarr](Ssithtarr "wikilink"), a portable mob that will give an
[insignia bearing quest](Ssithtarr's_Fur_Collection_Quest "wikilink") to
level 20-25 players.
