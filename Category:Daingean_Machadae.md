''Rising ominously from the center of [
Cathracharraig](:Category:Cathracharraig "wikilink"), Daingean Machadae
casts its sinister influence across northern Midgaardia. It is a keep of
pure gleaming obsidian, some days eclipsing the sun and enveloping whole
villages in darkness, other days blinding them with brilliant light
shows reflected off its glass surface; fickle behavior that perfectly
matches that of its mistress, [Tannah
Machadae](Tannah_Machadae "wikilink").

*Precious few enter or leave Daingean Machadae, as Mistress Mach prefers
to leave the everyday administration of her city to the underlings
stationed in the garrison. As such, no one truly knows what goes on
inside her stronghold. Foreigners have occasionally been spotted
arriving with little fanfare, only to be admitted through the grand
stairs to the west of the keep. And at night, when Cathracharraig quiets
down somewhat, citizens can hear a cacophany from within, fueling the
rumors that Mistress Mach has wrought something so terrible that she
battles it every night to maintain control of her kingdom.*

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 22n,e,n,2w,n,e  
Portal point: [Mserie the stonesmith](Mserie "wikilink"), .ses2e2n3e,
kill [captain](Riscgnarl "wikilink") for [Newly Minted Gate
Key](Newly_Minted_Gate_Key "wikilink") (attacking the captain will make
you an outlaw, steal the key if possible). Travel .4w & unlock west or
.3w2s2wne, unlock south, and go south to enter Daingean Machadae.
Alternately, you can portal directly to
[Riscgnarl](Riscgnarl "wikilink"), the lawful captain holding the key.

If you'd like to get a key to the area without becoming an outlaw, get
the [Poorly Copied Key](Newly_Minted_Gate_Key "wikilink") (pp wielmann,
track half -- but be a rogue or you'll get blackjacked in Outsiders),
and unlock the southern door in the grand entrance.

Another option is to kill the [Brooding
Magman](Brooding_Magman "wikilink") and get his [Heart Of
Magma](Heart_Of_Magma "wikilink"). Then drop this heart in the room "A
rising column of magma" downstairs in the
[Cathracharraig](Cathracharraig "wikilink") mines. This will create a
vortex on the ground which leads to a room "Immersed in fire!". Not
clear if you can do anything in that room (dropping items has no
effect), but that room contains an "opening"; if you enter opening
you'll end up at the downstairs outside room "A rising column of magma!"
in [Daingean Machadae](Daingean_Machadae "wikilink").

## Connections

-   [Cathracharraig](:Category:Cathracharraig "wikilink")

## Navigation

You will generally need to procure a key to enter the tower proper - by
both the main gate in the west, or the back gate in the east. Once
inside it is worth noting that doors will only remain for a limited
time, before closing and locking behind you, which can mean you get
locked out again. As such it may be a good idea to head to one of the
three balconies and set recall for easy return.

The layout for the tower is slightly confusing as there are six
different floors, but some of the up-down connections skip a floor. None
of the floors are very big though, and corridors generally run in an
east-west direction with the occassional room to the north or south -
generally locked.

-   **The first floor** can be accessed from the eastern 'back door',
    via [Cathracharraig](:Category:_Cathracharraig "wikilink"), if you
    have the key. This floor is where your corpse will turn up if you
    die in **the crucible**.
-   **The second floor** is reached from the **first** or from the
    western 'front door', also via Cathracharraig. Climbing from the
    public, outer part of the tower you can reach the **third floor**,
    but you will not be able to enter the tower proper without someone
    on the inside to open the door for you. You can also reach the next
    floor from some stairs at eastern side of the tower. There is also a
    way up out of the forest section in the middle of the tower, which
    takes you directly up to the **fourth floor**. A couple of locked
    rooms on this level hold mobs which may be of interest - for xp if
    nothing else. Also, this level is where the [ogre
    shaman](Ogre_Shaman "wikilink") can be found.
-   **The third floor** is where you can find the balconies which are
    not cursed, a door out to the public section of the tower which is
    openable from the inside, a rather nasty room full of aggressive
    mobs and possibly the toughest part of the whole area, a way up to
    the **fourth floor**, and path directly up to the **fifth**.
-   **The fourth floor** is home to a three deep gnome wizards, and a
    locked room with another one of Tannah's experiments (or pets). A
    route to the **fifth floor** can also be found here in a chaotic
    laboratory.
-   **The fifth floor** is very small and essentially just forms a
    connection between the **sixth** and a a couple of locked rooms just
    below the way up, most notable for one of them having the entrance
    to the **crucible**.
-   **the sixth floor** is [Tannah
    Machadae](Tannah_Machadae "wikilink")'s private quarters, and she
    can usually be found here unless someone has let her out to wander
    the tower.
-   **The crucible** is an additional section of the tower - presumably
    in the firey lava beneath it - which is accessed only via a vortex.
    It is no-spell and can be quite tough to get out alive. Fortunately,
    a death here will dump your corpse out on the **first floor** and
    all you have to worry about is getting back into the tower.

Once inside the tower, possession of three keys will grant you access to
the whole tower, as two of they keys open multiple doors.

## Adventuring

The corridors of the tower are fairly safe to wander, as most of the
trolls are not aggressive - one of the underlings being the exception.
The [Troll Assassin](Troll_Assassin "wikilink") (e, n, from west turret)
hits a bit harder than most as he is level 67 and uses the [Trollish
Light Crossbow](Trollish_Light_Crossbow "wikilink") (m76, +mh, +9hr,
invis) with [poison bolts](Poison_Bolts "wikilink"). Also, there are
several [Quicksilver Wolf Cubs](Quicksilver_Wolf_Cub "wikilink") which
wander the area and can pass through doors which ARE aggressive and can
see hidden. If you are careful and scan, these are the only dangers from
casually wandering the corridors. Any doors which can be passdoored are
safe to move through, as are any which open without a key.

There is one notable exception to this, which is a **very dangerous**
room. The room which contains Kragge,
[Szreaelle](Szreaelle_The_Spy "wikilink") and Z'tarr has about six mobs
inside, most of which are aggressive, tough, and have various unpleasant
combat specs on them. Enter this room at your own risk.

Having gained two keys (three if you want to enter the crucible), you
can then wander the rest of the tower and fight some of the special mobs
in their own special rooms, all of which are aggressive, but all to be
found on their own unless a [wolf cub](Quicksilver_Wolf_Cub "wikilink")
walks in.
