*Long ago, after recurring visions of a tremendous cataclysm, Aziz-Ra
ordered his followers to construct a huge pyramid deep in the Belast
Mountains. The cataclysm has come and he and his followers have holed up
here, practicing unholy rites and ritualistic sacrifices. Few people
venture here and of those that do, none return with a shred of sanity
left, raving of huge demons and ravenous monsters. Can you trust the
words of madmen? Who knows... but one thing is for certain, those that
inhabit the Dark Pyramid practice dark magic, some say they even consort
with demons, and they will punish you if you enter their domain.*
