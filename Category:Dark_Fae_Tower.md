*There is a rumor that, near the burning woods that are the
[Arcadian](:Category:Arcadia "wikilink") Planeshift point, there is a
dark spire beneath the plane's surface. At the end of a waterfall, on an
underground lake, the Dark Fae [Duke Zarradyn](Duke_Zarradyn "wikilink")
makes his home. Rumor has it he is able to ward his home against
Midgaardian magic while still allowing the Fae to use their own.*

*According to Lady Astra, "The Dark Fae? If you trespass in
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia "wikilink"), the GOOD ones will do all in
their power to destroy you, so don't expect too warm a welcome in
[Zarradyn's](Duke_Zarradyn "wikilink") tower."*
