*Somewhere in the south of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
there is a hole crawling with the darklin menace. Rumour has it that
this hole is difficult to enter and much more difficult to leave. The
darklin call the hole 'home' while wreaking havoc upon the other
creatures of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink").*

**Level Range:** 10-15

**Builder:** Pliny

## Connections

This area only connects to [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink").

## Navigation

-   The entryway to the area is safe and there is a big sign warning
    you. There is also a smaller mob to test your skills on before
    venturing futher.
-   The first level is divided up into a few smaller area. To avoid the
    [aggies](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") there are two safe spots here.
    Firstly there is a [fountain](Fountains "wikilink") of berry syrup
    in the storeroom to the west, which if drunk from **ONCE** will
    whisk you into a [safe room](Safe_Rooms "wikilink"). If you drink
    from it again though, [aggies](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") will be
    loaded. Also, if you make your way to the eastern section there is a
    crack in the wall which will take you to a safe room you can regen
    in or [recall](Recall "wikilink") from. However,
    [entering](Enter "wikilink") the crack will drain you of all your
    [HPs](Hit_Points "wikilink").
-   The second level is accessed by a hidden
    [door](:Category:_Doors "wikilink") in the eastern section using the
    carapace key from the [headmaster](Darklin_Headmaster "wikilink").
    This section is much smaller and mainly serves as a gauntlet to
    protect the [ruler](Darklin_Ruler "wikilink") on the the third
    level, which is but a single room.
-   ++Important++ The key to get out can be found walking from the room
    right after stepping in the hole: d, 2e, \[e\].

## Adventuring

This area is a lot of fun if you're interested in a challenge. The
entrance to the hole is a one-way exit, so once you enter you are stuck
until you find the way out. To make matters even more tricky, the whole
area is [cursed](Cursed_Rooms "wikilink"), so you can't
[recall](Recall "wikilink")/[sanc](Sanctum "wikilink") out of there. For
this reason, I HIGHLY suggest setting your [recall](Recall "wikilink")
right before entering the area. Otherwise, if you die, you'll have a
hard time getting back to your corpse in time. In general, the area
consists of wandering [aggies](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), and there
seems to be some useful [gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") there too. I
found a couple clues for a new [manifest](Manifest "wikilink") recipe
here too, but so far I haven't figured the whole thing out yet.

To enter this area, search the south of
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink"). The
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") containing the entrance to Darklin
Hole has a big scary warning in the room description.
