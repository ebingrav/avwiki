*Deep beneath the surface of Midgaardia, there is a small mining town of
[deep gnomes](Deep_Gnomes.md "wikilink") known as Deephome. They were
recently found by their surface cousins as the
[gnomes](Gnomes.md "wikilink") from above carved their own portion of
passages through the [Underway
Tunnels](:Category:_Underway_Tunnels.md "wikilink"). They now use the
[Underway](:Category:_Underway_Tunnels.md "wikilink") as a trading route
between the two villages.*
