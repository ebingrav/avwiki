*Far below the surface of Midgaardia dwell many races, some of which
prefer to live their entire lives without seeing the open sky or the
light of the sun. These races have long used a sprawling system of
tunnels and caves to move around from one place to another, without ever
setting foot above ground. One section of these caves are known as the
Deepways.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

## Navigation

This place is an area connector, like [ Valley Of The
Sun](:Category:_Valley_Of_The_Sun.md "wikilink") and [North Of
Ofcol](:Category:North_Of_Ofcol.md "wikilink"). Of the many exits, some
are recognizable by the monoliths standing by them.

In the lower part of this area, all rooms are cursed. If you wish to
recall out of the area, find a place where you can go up, or walk into
the connecting areas (some of those are cursed too so I recommend
walking up).

This area is made up of a series of interconnected tunnels and caves,
which tend to start from the edges of the map at higher elevations and
work their way towards the centre of the map and deeper down.

-   **A steep chasm** on the far west of the area leads from the
    [Fortress of Kra](:Category:_Fortress_Of_Kra.md "wikilink") down to
    **the Crystal Cavern**, and **a neatly carved passage** connects on
    [Graw Akkuurattaan](:Category:_Graw_Akkuurattaan.md "wikilink") and
    to bottom of **the Steps of Durr**.
-   **A played out series of mine shafts** connects the top of **the
    Steps of Durr** and [River
    Tunnels](:Category:_River_Tunnels.md "wikilink").
-   **A forest of fungus** runs from the bottom of **the Steps of Durr**
    in a south-easterly direction to **The Hall of the Mountain King**,
    and the entrance to [Fungal
    Forest](:Category:_Fungal_Forest.md "wikilink") proper can be found
    here.
-   **A long-dry underground river** runs from below **the Hall of the
    Mountain King** to the [Rivers of
    Avatar](:Category:_Rivers_Of_Avatar.md "wikilink") near an entrance
    to [Flipside Altar](:Category:_Flipside_Altar.md "wikilink"), via
    the **Pyramid Cave**, and is essentially the furthest south the area
    extends. **The Hall of the Mountain King** also connects to the
    [Ruins of Reveria](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria.md "wikilink") above.
-   **A subterranean canyon** connects **the Grand Sinkhole**, which
    forms the entrance from [Great
    Divide](:Category:_Great_Divide.md "wikilink"), **the Well of Lost
    Dreams** and **the Painted Cave** in the the north-west with
    **Fallen Angel Cave**.
-   **A wide glacial, tunnel** runs from **Fallen Angel Cave** east and
    north the [Iceways](:Category:_Iceways.md "wikilink"), close to the
    entrance to [Icewolf](:Category:_Icewolf.md "wikilink") and can be
    considered the most northern limit of the area.
-   **A sharply sloping passage** runs north-east from **the
    Amphitheatre** but ends in a dead end.
-   **A twisting lava tube** runs for some distance east of **the
    Amphitheatre** via the **Cavern of Seven Echoes** before twisting
    south to reach **the Cloisters**, **Earthheart Grotto** and **the
    Spider's Stair**.
-   **A fault in the earth** joins the **Cavern of Seven Echoes** with
    [Cavern of the Fates](:Category:_Cavern_Of_The_Fates.md "wikilink")
    in the [Wildwood](:Category:Wildwood.md "wikilink").
-   **A limestone gallery** connects **the Spider's Stair** with [Shadow
    Forest](:Category:_Shadow_Forest.md "wikilink") and via the
    **Cerulean Pool** forms a dead end in the south east of the area.
-   **A labyrinth of catacombs** connects all of the central and deepest
    part of the area, in a rough circle, including touching on **the
    Hall of the Mountain King**, **Pyramid Cave**, **Fallen Angel
    Cave**, **the Amphitheatre** and the entrance to [Veil of
    Ecstasy](:Category:Veil_Of_Ecstasy.md "wikilink").

If a person is sufficiently [alert](Alertness.md "wikilink") they can
find a **comfortable hidey hole** that is a nice
[infirmary](:Category:Infirmaries.md "wikilink") in this area with a
stream that will [invigorate](Invigorate.md "wikilink") when
[quaffed](quaff.md "wikilink").

On rare occasions one one may find a temple north of the **Fallen Angel
Cave**.

## Adventuring

**Note:** This area was changed in July 2012 to be run in groups of size
\<= 3. Anything above that will drastically reduce xp gained.

The mobs in this area are generally of levels 65 and up. Each time a mob
is killed, it will spawn a larger version of itself somewhere in the
area (up to a maximum, of course). If you are the only group/person in
the area, you should expect xp and difficulty to gradually increase
towards the end of the run.

If you are not the only group/person in the area, please be considerate
in choosing which mobs to kill. Someone else might have been trying to
spawn that mob you're about to kill.

The area has a huge variety of the mobs - almost a hundred unique mobs,
and many of them carry special rewards, can be skinned for quest
tickets, or give gems and large amounts of gold. See the [Mobs in
Deepways](:Category:Mobs_In_Deepways.md "wikilink") section for a
breakdown of mob chains and rewards.

Watch out for the Adventurer mobs ("Party of Adventurers" for example)
as they can cast inconvenient spells such as Earthbind (removes fly),
Dispel Magic (can remove half your current spells), and Deception (can
cause you to remove and possibly drop equipment).

<b>Beware:</b> there is at least one corpse-eater, and several mobs
scavenge corpses and items off the ground.

The area also connects to [Fungal Forest](Fungal_Forest "wikilink")
where you'll see a myconoid meditating (Psilocybin). The room is full
safe.

Depending on where you choose to start running this area - essentially
your selection of which portal point to use - you will generally fight
your way along one of the tunnels towards the **labyrinth of catacombs**
and from there branch out to clear the tunnels which connect out from
the middle. Depending on the size of the group and the tunnels you
choose, it can make a good run to skip briefly into some of the other
connecting areas such as [ Great
Divide](:Category:_Great_Divide.md "wikilink"), [Fungal
Forest](:Category:_Fungal_Forest.md "wikilink") or [Cavern of the
Fates](:Category:_Cavern_Of_The_Fates.md "wikilink"), and then to return
back into Deepways for a continued run.
