*The Great Wall was built to protect the lands west of the Wild Wood
from the dangers which lurked in those dangerous lands. The king of
[Midgaard](:Category:Midgaard.md "wikilink") declared that those men and
women who had given their life defending, building and maintaining the
Wall's security, and hence the security of the realm itself, should be
honoured with a special resting place of their own. So Defender's
Graveyard came into existance, a final resting place for those who died
to keep others safe, in the shadow of the Great Wall itself. In recent
time though, a taint has begun to insinuate itself into the cemetary,
and not all the dead rest as they should.*

## Navigation

This is a simple layout with only a few gotchas. The graveyard can be
roughly divided into two parts; a well tended and normal burial ground
to the north, and an overgrown and undead infested section to the south.
An overgrown hill in the centre of the yard forms somewhat of a natural
barrier between the safer northern section and the more dangerous
southern section. Both sections are navigable by mostly just wandering
around in a east/west fashion.

The main entrance from Defender's Way leads into the north section. On
the west side of the area is a gate to a clearing in Sunset Wood, a part
of [Nocte Abbey](:Category:Nocte_Abbey.md "wikilink"). Routes between
the northern and southern sections of the graveyard are to be easily
found along the eastern and western sides, circumventing the hill in the
centre.

To the south is a down path to the fields of dead corn in the [Haunted
Forest](:Category:Haunted_Forest.md "wikilink"). One tomb leads down to
[Ruined Lair (5)](:Category:Ruined_Lair_5_Of_5.md "wikilink") so be
careful. Access to the top of the hill is also from this section.

There are also a good number of rooms in both sections that require you
to enter something to get into (mausoleum, tombs, etc) and one that only
opens when you kill a mob.

## Adventuring

The north section is the safer of the two parts. The mobs here are not
aggressive, and many of them (but not all) are easier to fight. Most of
them will wander about, and the ghosts will be invisible to lower level
characters. Most of the mobs here are generally good aligned, or neutral
so keeping your alignment negative is easy.

The south section is more dangerous and contains all of the aggie mobs,
none of which wander. The mobs in this part are generally a little bit
harder than those in the north, and most are undead. Needless to say,
most of the mobs here are evil, so keeping your alignment positive is
easy.
