*The first adventurer that returned from this place babbled incoherently
for weeks about ghosts, [demons](Demons.md "wikilink"), devils, and pies
that bite back? Only the skilled healing of
[Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink") could eventually restore the man's sanity
long enough for him to speak of a well-hidden entrance in the depths of
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink"). No more could be learned,
unfortunately, as the brave adventurer died screaming after being
offered a chicken pie.*

## Adventuring

This area was similar to the grandfathered Underdark area of the
1990s/early 2000s with respect to the wide disparity in mob levels
(teens to hero+) and creative room/npc descriptions (pot pies, gold
coins, judicial characters, etc.). It was accessible through various
holes in the ground around Midgaardia, most notably in the house found
in Fewmaster's Folley. Alas, like many such non-thematic areas, it got
the chop. The area is no longer accessible.
