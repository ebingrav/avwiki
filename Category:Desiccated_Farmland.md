*This once bustling farmland has now turned into an ever-growing desert
in the hands of the venerable geomancer, Mistress Mach. Her anger is
said to have been ignited by an exiled guard who stole something from
her before fleeing. Framed by the mountainous region of the [Barrier
Wastes](:Category:_Barrier_Wastes.md "wikilink") to the west and south
as well as the [Tortured
Terrain](:Category:_Tortured_Terrain.md "wikilink") to the east, the
farmers have either been killed outright or remained trapped within, as
the paths out of the land are said to be guarded by large man-eating...
rocks? Well, you can't trust all second-hand information.*
