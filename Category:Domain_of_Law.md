*The push and pull of Law and Chaos as they try to influence the planes
is rarely noticed by planar inhabitants though they sometimes play a
role for one side or the other. Champions of either side usually act
indirectly but sometimes a hands-on approach is needed.*

*The kaleidoscope of their interactions can be seen in the furthest
reaches of the realms and even more so at the doorsteps of Chaos and
Law.*

## Directions

[Planeshift](Planeshift "wikilink") to
[Astral](:Category:Astral.md "wikilink") and go d, d, w

## Connections

Go east,east to visit the [Realm of
Chaos](:Category:Realm_of_Chaos.md "wikilink").

## Navigation

Visit the dragon Bestellen and 'salute' to start your trip.

This leads to a modest-sized maze of rooms called "White Strands". The
maze seems to get smaller as you kill more lattice workers? Exploring
long enough gets you to a room with one exit, Down, to the Astral
Dragon.

## Adventuring

Bestellen gives out quests and you can cash in the results for insignia.

In order to start collecting achievements you either "salute bestellen",
give an exceptionally useless trinket to Alleg, or give bound chaos to
Knutselaar (can ask him to give back) before you start any achievements.

"kneel bestellen" to see your progress or to redeem progress.

Example progress update:

Quest 1:  
Bestellen says 'You have yet to achieve the Cornerstones of Law.'

Bestellen says 'Congratulations, you have earned the Cornerstones of Law
for visiting the extreme corners of the tesseract.'

Bestellen says 'It appears you have already been rewarded for the
Cornerstones of Law.'

Quest 2:  
Bestellen says 'Congratulations Dragon Slayer! You have earned this
reward.'

Bestellen says 'You have already been recognized for slaying the
dragon.'

Bestellen says 'But thank you again Dragon Slayer.'

Quest 3:  
Bestellen says 'You have yet to face the maelstrom.'

Bestellen says 'Chaos has been Vanquished! Let all recognize your
accomplishments.'

Bestellen says 'Thank you again for Vanquishing Chaos.'

Quest 4:  
Bestellen says 'Keep trying to put those square pegs in the round
holes.'

Bestellen says 'I feel so much better now that you have put Everything
in its Place.'

Bestellen says 'You have already been rewarded for putting Everything in
its Place.'

Quest 5:'''  
Bestellen says 'The most useless of things still must have purpose if
Law is to prevail.'

Bestellen says 'Thank you for finding purpose for useless things Chaos
has created.'

Bestellen says 'Even the Junker helps achieve the aims of Law.

Bestellen says 'That Junker collects almost anything.'

Quest 6:  
Bestellen says 'You won't fully understand our enemy until you find your
way through their realm.'

Bestellen says 'A true Explorer finds opportunities and shortcuts in
Chaos.'

Bestellen says 'Ahh, someone that has stepped upon the precipice of
every window.'

Quest 7:  
Bestellen says 'If you walk in my footsteps long enough you may yet
understand Law the way I do.'

Bestellen says 'The Wanderer doesn't let things like collapsing walls
get in their way.'

Bestellen says 'The Wanderer has returned from traveling.'

Bestellen says 'Someday you will have accomplished it all.'

### Mobs

Lattice workers have 3 keywords ("spider" - 40 mobs; "caterpillar" - 38
mobs, and "fly" - 40 mobs).

Mobs in this area are all good aligned, so bring someone who can preach
absolve or you will lose anti-neutral gear.

caterpillars are melee immune (at least archery immune)

### Geometry

One sub-quest in Domain of Law is shape-related.

\(1\) There are 3 special shape rooms.

\(2\) \*Once per character's incarnation\* you can fill the hole (a
single player can only ever be present in the room for filling of hole
1, filling of hole 2, filling of hole 3, etc). Subsequent attempts by
the same character to fill the hole will fail.

If you're in the room you'll get credit for completing that hole.

\(3\) Complete all 3 holes and win a special insignia prize!

#### Shapes

Some lattice workers carry shapes, which are trash type, weight 50
objects that are cursed. Shapes we have seen:

Room I

-   cylinder (The circular hole extends straight down, keeping the same
    shape down below.)
-   cuboid (The square hole extends straight down, keeping the same
    shape down below.)
-   dodecahedron (The depression has a pentagonal shape with eleven of
    the exacting same shape revealed inside the hole.)
-   icosahedron (A score of triangles are cut into the white surface)
-   rhombus (looks like a cube would fit inside if it has been warped
    slightly from its perfect shape)
-   tetrahedron (The hole is a perfect triangle shape with triangular,
    wedged sides cut into the wall.)

Room II

-   cone (perfect circle that gets smaller and smaller until the hole
    ends at a point)
-   cube (The interior of the indentation is perfectly regular. Each of
    the cube hole's five square sides meets at a right angle.)
-   frustum (The indentation appears to be a perfect circle that gets
    smaller and smaller until the hole ends at a smaller circle.)
-   sphere (It appears that a globe would be needed to fill the hole.)
-   triangular prism (The three-sided hole extends straight down,
    keeping the same shape down below.)

Room III

-   ellipsoid (The egg-shaped cavity may have given birth to one of the
    creatures wandering about.)
-   hexagonal prism (The six-sided hole extends straight down, keeping
    the same shape down below.)
-   octahedron (Gazing into the trianglur cavity you can see that
    something gouged out a hole that has uniform dimensions on all eight
    sides.)
-   square pyramid (perfect square that gets smaller and smaller until
    the hole ends at a point)
-   torus (A large, white, circular channel has been eaten into the
    surface of the strands.)

` Object 'triangular prism' type trash, extra flags glow hum magic nolocate.`  
` Weight 50, value 9300, level 125.`  
` Object Quality (500 / 500 hps)`

Shapes load cursed and the first room is nospell, so remove curse in
advance or bring a nospell remove-curse item (traveller's holy symbol /
sceptre of controlling shadows).

#### Shape sorting

At the end of your journey, you'll enter the Axial Dragon's room. Send a
tank in first for the first 3 times you visit. The dragon will hit the
tank, then pull in the whole group, then send the whole group to one of
3 different rooms.

` The Axial Dragon draws a deep breath, pulling everyone in the vicinity closer.`  
` Force is released from the dragon's maw, throwing you like a twig through the air.`

Once you've witnessed the filling of all 3 holes, then done "kneel
bestellen", you'll get a special hole-filling reward.

The shape is consumed, and the hole disappears.

### Special Chaos exits

The Realm of Chaos is scattered across multiple different areas in
multiple different planes (all named Realm of Chaos).

Throughout the Realm of Chaos there are special rooms, one per plane,
which may have 4 or 6 exits.

Example of a special room:

` The Abyss`  
` [Exits: north east south west]`  
` Faces of various sizes fade in and out of the ether, never quite fully`  
` forming, yet solid enough to obstruct the view of what lies beyond.`  
` They seem to be canine from their features, but this may just be`  
` influenced by the barking noises they are making.`  
`   `  
` Players near you in Tarterus Plane, Area - { LORD } Ctibor  Realm of Chaos`

Sometimes, some of these rooms have 6 exits. When they have 6 exits, the
up and down exits lead to interesting places on their host planes.

Example of a special room with a bonus exit (not sure what controls
this; seen at 5am mud time):

` The Abyss`  
` [Exits: north east south west up down]`  
` Spurts of flame occasionally disrupt the ash and cinders being carried`  
` by the wind. The flames are quickly smothered by the smoke only to`  
` appear again a moment later. Small islands of rock are made visible`  
` by the sporadic light cast off from the fire light.`  
` `  
` Players near you in FireRealm Plane, Area - { LORD } Ctibor  Realm of Chaos`

` You scan your surroundings...`  
`   North: `  
`    You see no one here.`  
`    East: `  
`    (Flying) (White Aura) A creature of chaos hunts through the realm in search of you.`  
`    South: `  
`    You see no one here.`  
`    West: `  
`    You see no one here.`  
`    Up: `  
`    (Flying) (Demonic) (Black Aura) Soaring overhead, an imp scans for signs of life.`  
`    (Demonic) (Black Aura) A majestic dragon perches upon the cliffside.`  
`    Down: `  
`    (Pink Aura) (Demonic) (Black Aura) A demon works at the emberforge tirelessly. `

The achievement for visiting every special room seems to trigger once a
player has saluted, then visited every special room at least once in
their incarnation. I was able to complete this stumbling around randomly
alone as a bladedancer in about 90 minutes, with frequent visits back to
Thorngate, occasionally dying. I found it helpful to write an alias to
do "drop 1 coin:where:scan" as I visited each room and got a little more
familiar with the layout of the Chaos subarea.

To get back out from Chaos you can teleport or portal away as you
normally would on the relevant planes (for example "c tele frost giant"
from Water). Appears that you cannot homeshift or planeshift to
thorngate directly from within Chaos. Also appears you can't
teleport/portal away on Karnath. A lot of rooms are in Astral and gith
pris is a pretty reliable portal point.

#### Available shortcuts

Tarterus: garden statues

Kzin: Spire mob gear room

Fire: Up: Majestic dragon, Down: Iconoclaster

We have seen special rooms for sure in fire, kzin, stone, water, arc,
air, tart. I think there are also special rooms in astral, karn, noct,
out.

## Unlocking Realm of Chaos

After you give the perfect dragon scale to Bestellen he drops a tablet
on the floor and says

` Bestellen says 'The directions etched into this tablet will guide you through the chaos to its heart.'`  
` Bestellen says 'Follow them exactly after you first step into chaos from the rainbow portal.'`  
` Bestellen says 'If you stray from the path you will have to start at the first step again.'`

He drops a tablet on the floor in his room that has some directions:

`    (Glowing) A tablet rests on a solid, white pedestal placed just before the throne.`  
` You look at the white tablet here...`  
` Directions through the chaos have been etched deeply into the tablet.`  
` The tablet appears to be part of the pedestal so you will probably`  
` have to write them down on something if you want to take them with`  
` you.`  
` (Look DIRECTION1, DIRECTION2 etc)`

For exmaple, one time, these were edswdeeuesdn. The directions start
from the Realm of Chaos which is two east of Bestellen (i.e. first go
two east before starting your directions). These directions lead to a
large room (8 mobs, they hit a trl sor soloing for about 30k/round,
Kinetisch is a big one). Bliksem is a stormlord, so bring a Psi/Mnd to
use shatterspell on him. The second to last room in the directions (ie
one before the boss room) only contains one mob and mobs don't wander
into this room so it makes for an ideal location to regen.

If you give him something after this, but before killing the Realm of
Chaos mobs, he drops it:

` You give a bright ball of light to Bestellen.`  
` Bestellen says 'I cannot accept anything until the task in chaos is complete.'`  
` Bestellen drops everything.`

He also gives a clue that something on the Chaos side can improve the
base of manifest gear (i.e. bound chaos):

` say 'chaos'`  
` Bestellen says 'Epic armor doesn't always reach full potential when created.'`  
` Bestellen says 'This has a chance of changing that outcome if used by the right hands.'`

## Misc

Bestellen gives clues about area mechanics and rewards. Try:

` say dragon`  
` Bestellen says 'The dragon can project the force of Law.' `  
` Bestellen says 'This expunges chaos from its presence for a short time.' `  
` Bestellen says 'It can only do this a limited number of times.''`

` say tesseract`  
` Bestellen says 'The tesseract is the embodiement of true law.'`  
` Bestellen says 'At its core rests perfection incarnate in the form of a dragon.'`

` say poly trinket`  
` Bestellen says 'This could be used for almost anything.'`  
` Bestellen says 'Assuming the anything is something useless.'`

` say bound chaos`  
` Bestellen says 'Epic armor doesn't always reach full potential when created.'`  
` Bestellen says 'This has a chance of changing that outcome if used by the right hands.'`

We also found an invisible mob called The Tesseract when someone
accidentally scattershotted it and died immediately:

` The Tesseract fades into existence.`  
` The Tesseract's attacks strike Baeindor 10 times, with terminal brutality!`  
` Baeindor is DEAD!!`  
` [DEATH INFO]: Baeindor killed by The Tesseract in White Strands (22638).`  
` (Hide) (Flying) (White Aura) (Sneak) A collapsing cube reflects all of time and space.`  
` look tesseract`  
` Mprog control mob for rooms in Domain of Law.`  
` The Tesseract is in perfect health.`  
` You peek at the inventory:`

Bestellen's room is noregen (but spring rain works).

## Gear

The axial dragon has:

-   perfect dragon scale: Give this to Bestellen and he'll drop a tablet
    on the floor, unlocking Realm of Chaos.
-   2x orderly dragon scale: These are worth 5qp if you hand them to
    Knutselaar.
-   [Yet Another Dragon Scale](Yet_Another_Dragon_Scale "wikilink"):
    give to [Allegaagse](Allegaagse "wikilink") for esteem points (ie to
    increase your alleg insig progress). Don't bother using on a Task
    Master alt.

The chaos side has:

-   bound chaos: treasure item. Allows a lord manifest item to be
    rerolled.
-   poly trinket (Ever changing junk): Accepted by Alleg in place of any
    other item.
-   exceptionally useless item - give to alleg, then give to bestellen
    and kneel for a special insignia \[keyword is trinket\]

## Vagonuth's Run Notes

#### Law

To start, have everyone salute Bestellen (astral, 3d, w) which will take
them to a room one up from him. Once everyone is in, move one east from
there and you'll be in a cube (approx 5x5x5).

Walk around the cube killing stuff. I alternate between going north and
going south on each run to try and reach as many corners as possible
before the cube starts getting smaller (gets smaller with killing mobs,
possibly with moving too).

For example on a north run, I would try to work my way north and then go
either up/down (whichever has less mobs) till I reach the NW corner. I
then move down/up to reach the 2nd NW corner, I then work my way east so
I can try to get the two other NE corners. I can often get folks
cornerstones in two separate runs with this method.

Keep killing things, the cube will eventually become one room with a
down only (to the Axial dragon).

Have folks RC shapes here since Room \#1 of shape sorting is no spell.
This is a good time to regen if needed though most groups don't need any
regen.

Send a tank down, the dragon will hit them, then drag the entire group
into the first shape sorting room (this one is nospell). To insert a
shape, you need a group mate who hasn't done shapes before to insert
them. See [shape sorting](:Category:Domain_of_Law#Shapes.md "wikilink")
above.

Send a tank towards the dragon again for Room \#2, and then again for
Room \#3. The next time you visit the dragon will be the final fight. I
usually just walk in to let a stabber stab. He's pretty easy but you can
use any of the shape sorting rooms to regen if needed.

After you beat/loot him, the next room will be Bestellen again. Have
groupies kneel to update their insignia.

Before homeshifting, give Bestellen the perfect scale to unlock chaos
(prevents having to find it later / locking future groups out of it).

#### Chaos

Once the perfect scale from Law is given to Bestellen, Law becomes
locked off and Chaos opens up. Bestellen drops a tablet on the group
with directions through the maze (see [mudlet
alias](:Category:Domain_of_Law#Mudlet_Helper_Alias.md "wikilink") below
for quickly obtaining this directions). Note: this run is harder than
Law and requires a bit more tankage/firepower. Having 2 big tanks / 3
mediums tanks and/or a bladedancer helps. Additionally, a Psi/Mnd is
helpful for shatter which is sometimes needed.

There are twelve directions in total (room \#12 is the boss fight).

To get to the first room of Chaos, head 2e from Bestellen. You are now
in a one-way maze. If a groupie gets left behind, they will need to find
you. Most of Chaos (on the main maze path atleast) is not
portable/planeable/homeshiftable/gurneyable. It can be quite swarmy in
here so move slow.

Follow the maze until you reach Room \#11. Room \#11 contains one mob
only (no walk-ins) so its ideal for regenning. You can use 'create
shrine' here and the room is also Lloydable so move the anchor if you
lost any groupies along the way so the can plane in before the boss
room.

The next room is the boss room and can be difficult. Bliksem is a
stormlord that is sometimes here so bring a Psi/Mnd to use shatterspell
on him. There's a number of mobs so having some AOE helps and certainly
have your Bladedancer max veil if available. Note: you can avoid having
the classed mobs spawn here by bringing along a groupmate of the same
class (ie, bring a stormlord to avoid having a stormlord mob spawn).

Once the room is cleared, Law will open up again. You can get out of
Chaos by pp 2.gith pris then homeshifting (you may need to move one room
to do so).

## Mudlet Helper Alias

You can create an Alias in Mudlet to quickly inspect the tablet with the
following code snippet:

` local dirs = {}`  
` `  
` tmpDirTrigger = tempRegexTrigger("^(North|South|East|West|Up|Down)", function() `  
`   table.insert(dirs, matches[2])`  
`   if #dirs == 12 then`  
`     local string = ""`  
` `  
`     for i = 1, 12 do`  
`       string = string .. string.lower(string.sub(dirs[i],1,1))`  
`       if i ~= 12 then string = string .. "," end`  
`     end`  
`     `  
`     send("gtell Dirs: " .. string)`  
`   end`  
` end, 12)`  
` `  
` for i = 1, 12 do`  
`  send("look direction" .. i)`  
` end`
