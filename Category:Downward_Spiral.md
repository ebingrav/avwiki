*Deep within the swamps and boglands of Wildwood, there sits a
reflecting pool, mirror smooth and pristine. Nothing from the woods
dares drink from its still waters. None approach it, a space twenty
paces wide where birds do not sing, and animals dare not tread. It is a
pool of despair, its reflection tainted by some unknown source, stealing
away the hope and joy of any who gaze upon it. Who knows what lies
beneath the mirror surface?*

## Connections

You enter the area by drinking from a pool south from the [Crescent
Bog](Crescent_Bog "wikilink").  
Drink tea in the last room and be restored and transported to [Aelmon's
Sanctuary](Aelmon's_Sanctuary_(Midgaard).md "wikilink").

## Navigation

Most of this area is just one long road, spiralling downwards (wow, go
figure). With only one exception, the rooms have two exists. As for the
exception, south leads further down, and the other directions take you
back one room.

## Adventuring

Be careful of this area's backbiting daggers, as they can bring quick
death to lowmorts and even to lowheroes; using
[sneak](Sneak.md "wikilink") and [move
hidden](Move_Hidden.md "wikilink") and [invis](Invis.md "wikilink") can
help protect oneself from these deadly mobs.  
Near the end, a few rooms after the [Sad Man](Sad_Man "wikilink"),
there's a shapeshifter, [Mimic](Mimic "wikilink"), so watch out. Right
after that is a safe room with [Requiem](Requiem_(mob).md "wikilink") in
there. He's involved in a few ticket quests.
