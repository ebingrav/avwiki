*The great sea [dragon](Dragons "wikilink") [Myxss](Myxss "wikilink")
claims this atoll as her lair. She has mingled in sorcery, creating a
race of super [lizardmen](Lizardmen "wikilink") to guard her atoll. She
raids far and wide, destroying ships of all nations and allegiances,
earning her the animosity of both [Lord Audis](Lord_Audis "wikilink")
and of the various pirate clans. Her wealth is said to be unmatched, as
is the viciousness of her guards.*

## Navigation

## Adventuring

The top layer has no mobs on it. The bottom two layer has various draqs
(green, black, white, chromatic), [Amyt](Amyt_The_Overseer "wikilink"),
and [snipers](Sniper "wikilink") that will shoot you yet you cannot
reach. The snipers and various draqs (green and chromatic) are aggie and
the draqs will [tail](Racial_Tail "wikilink") you. Various draqs have a
ticket ([green scale](Green_Scale "wikilink")) that when given to Amyt
will transport you to a highly aggie area with [corpse
eating](Corpse-Eating_Mobs "wikilink") mobs. This leads to the main
dragon [Myxss](Myxss "wikilink"). Along the way the [turquoise
draq](Turquoise_Draq "wikilink") will drop a nice
[shield](Turquoise_Scale_Shield "wikilink"). The experience with the
draqs is not bad and if you avoid the anti-magic rooms (if you are a
caster) and getting swarmed you should do fine. There is a treasure room
if you can get the key and a [very heavy
piercer](Turquoise_Claw "wikilink"). The door at the top is not
recommended unless you are a fighter who likes to get swarmed.

There is a room of quicksand that prevents magic from being cast and has
no exits. One adventurer spent many hours trying to escape. The trick is
to seek [Sanctum](Sanctum "wikilink"), as the room is not cursed.

## Affects

As of October 2011, the area features a small increase in experience
gains, a major increase in hp regeneration, and no loss of self on
death.
