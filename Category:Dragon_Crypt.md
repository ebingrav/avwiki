*The crypt is the resting place of this realm's deceased
[Dragons](Dragons.md "wikilink"), and is guarded by ferocious wyrm
servants. Seeking [treasure](:Category:_Treasure.md "wikilink"), a well
known party of Midgaardian adventurers set out in search of the crypt
recently, led by [Svlad the Very
Burly](Svlad_The_Very_Burly.md "wikilink") and
[Millament](Millament_The_Mad_Necromancer.md "wikilink"), High Sister of
the Order of UL. It has been a long time since that party disappeared
east of what once was [Ofcol](:Category:_Ofcol.md "wikilink").*

## Navigation

The area is a simple loop with a single branch going downwards towards
[Tryystania The DracoLich](Tryystania_The_DracoLich "wikilink")'s lair.
Most of the area is cursed save for the introductionary room (where
[Svlad The Very Burly](Svlad_The_Very_Burly "wikilink") serves as portal
point), and the room just above Tryystania's lair (an excellent place to
set recall in case of impending untimely death).

## Adventuring

The area is not overly complicated or difficult, and is very small -
only 14 rooms in size. Most of the mobs (save for Tryystania) will not
see hidden characters, making it a simple affair to sneak into the pit,
set recall above Tryystania's room, and then quickly strike at the
undead dragon and [Millament The Mad
Necromancer](Millament_The_Mad_Necromancer "wikilink") - the invisible
necromancer in the room. Both have relevant gear (see the treasure
hunting page below).

While doing this, it is wise to have [autoloot](Autoloot.md "wikilink")
on as well as [autosac](Autosac.md "wikilink") - otherwise Millament
will animate Tryystania and you will be in for yet another fight.

Aside for these monetary and gear reasons, the area is rarely run.
