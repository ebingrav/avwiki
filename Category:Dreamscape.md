## Adventuring

The first room of this area (the portal room) is
[lloydable](lloydable "wikilink"). After you enter portal, wander some
more till you find the room "Snow capped
mountain"([lloydable](lloydable "wikilink")) with the mob A nightmare
guardian ((Flying) (White Aura) This nightmarish creature prepares to
attack.). After you quaff from pool, it is one way path to Father of
Knives. Stop here and prepare your group. Down is silent room, after
silent room is private room, then you pick a direction which is (as far
as i know) random. One of the rooms is not no-spell, rest are. Tank
picks a direction and rest of the group goes down and scan to follow.
Dont pick the direction beforehand. As that direction might not be
available. Oh, and you cant go back to group since there is no way back.
After you kill 1-2 mobs, enter sphere for the gear room. You might want
to regen first since you will be fighting 4 big mobs.
