*For many aeons the [drow](Drow "wikilink") lived in relative peace with
other [races](:Category:_Races "wikilink") deep under the ground. Now,
they have found themselves invaded by the [duergar](Duergar "wikilink")
armies of [King Domi](King_Domi "wikilink"). Having grown decadent and
relying on their magic they were unable to defend themselves. The
[duergar](Duergar "wikilink") have already taken over large parts of the
city, and [drow](Drow "wikilink") forces are losing ground rapidly. Many
have died, many have fled. The outcome is not yet determined, but the
end of the fabled drow city is nearing...*

## Connections

## Navigation

The city is divided into two distinct sections with a no-man's-land in
the middle.

-   The eastern section is entered from the [Duergar
    Stronghold](:Category:_Duergar_Stronghold "wikilink") and is held by
    the invading duergar forces. Also found here in the south eastern
    corner are a pet shop and a herb shop. Blocks to the west open into
    the no-man's-land.
-   The no-man's-land contains the wreckage of two of the former drow
    acadamies and further access to the western half of the city is
    denied by a web. Passdoor will take you past, or find the amulet on
    the hidden scout which also acts as a key.
-   The western part of the city is still under the control of the
    [drow](Drow "wikilink"). Here are found the surviving two drow noble
    houses, the temple to the Spider Queen and a connection to the much
    higher level area, [The Veil of
    Ecstasy](:Category:_Veil_Of_Ecstasy "wikilink"). It is in this
    section where most of the interesting
    [equipment](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") can be found.

## Adventuring

`  ********THIS AREA HAS BEEN REMOVED, NOVEMBER 2010**********`

Drow city was an old area connected to the Duergar Stronghold, where one
could get lowmort xp until about level 20, buy pets from Draccho or
herbs from Angelika. It has been unfortunately removed and replaced with
"Graw Akkuurataan".
