*While Druids outwardly follow [Roixa](Roixa "wikilink"), their Order
truly venerates a far more ancient Goddess, whom they credit with the
creation of the natural world. Druids have a variety of healing and
protective spells, common to [clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink"),
but also learn much of the way of the wild, including
[bow](:Category:_Bows "wikilink") use, and several archery skills. They
also possess the unique ability to craft and use [mystic
arrows](:Category:_Mystic_Warheads "wikilink").*

*Like all [Prestige Classes](:Category:_Prestige_Classes "wikilink"),
they retain the original class's [Prime
Requisite](Prime_Requisite "wikilink"), in this case,
[Wisdom](Wisdom "wikilink"). Druids sometimes hang up their bows and
become [Priests](:Category:_Priests "wikilink"), but this requires a
higher level than it would for a
[cleric](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink"). Because they eschew melee
weapons, Druids cannot become
[Paladins](:Category:_Paladins "wikilink").*

*Druid masters tend to favor serene glades for their havens.*

## Druids in General

Druids can be summarized as [Clerics](:Category:Clerics "wikilink") with
bows and with cheaper heals, minus the [Pantheon
Spells](:Category:Pantheon_Spells "wikilink"). While they are not as
powerful as [Archers](:Category:Archers "wikilink") in combat, they are
good at healing groups for a long time while still contributing to
damage during runs.

## Druid Creation

Requirements:

-   level 50 Cleric
-   No racial penalty to archery
-   Unwavering worship of Roixa

Races that can potentially gain the druid prestige:
[Centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink"), [Demonseeds](Demonseeds "wikilink"),
[Drow](Drow "wikilink"), [Elves](Elves "wikilink"), [Half
Elves](Half-Elf "wikilink"), [Half-Orcs](Half-Orc "wikilink"), [High
Elves](High_Elf "wikilink"), [Humans](Humans "wikilink"),
[Kzinti](Kzinti "wikilink"), [Orcs](Orcs "wikilink"),
[Sprites](Sprites "wikilink"), and [Tuataurs](Tuataurs "wikilink").

Unwavering worship to Roixa means a potential cleric cannot worship (or
unworship) any other god prior to becoming a druid. However:

-   at levels 10 through 19 (including) one is allowed to experiment
    with any worship, as always. If you do, **remember** to unworship at
    lvl 19.
-   at levels 20-50 one *must* remain atheist or worship Roixa
    consistently.

Since Roixa will decrease melee damage, a new cleric will be better off
remaining atheist until becoming a druid.

## Druids at Hero Tier

Once a druid practices [Druidic Oath](Druidic_Oath "wikilink"), the bow
(or crossbow) will become the only weapon they use. Druidic Oath
provides a 15% spell cost reduction while wielding a bow however there's
a penalty of 5x the mana cost without one. The spell cost
reduction/increase is applied multiplicatively with other modifiers,
i.e.:

`casting spell cost = 85% (1 - 0.15) for druidic oath * racial modifier * worship modifier * original spell cost`

Druids also have access to specialized ammo.

### Training

Train stats as if any spellcaster class: wisdom and intelligence for
practice points and mana, then constitution. Strength and dexterity can
be trained later.

### Practicing

Practicing for a druid should be same as for a cleric. Focus on
party-beneficial spells like the divinity and mass divinity stack,
curative spells, and utility spells like fly or water breathing. Once
101 little will change, as there are few important skills or spells
after this point, until lord tier.

Druids can cast [Barkskin](Barkskin "wikilink"), similar to archers, but
they cannot [Skin](Skin "wikilink") corpses. They will miss out on [Dark
Embrace](Dark_Embrace "wikilink") which clerics otherwise get.

-   [Green Arrow](Green_Arrow "wikilink"), [Faerie
    Arrow](Faerie_Arrow "wikilink"), [Moonshard
    Arrow](Moonshard_Arrow "wikilink") and [Autumn
    Arrow](Autumn_Arrow "wikilink") are all special arrows that only
    druids can fletch and they behave similarly to standard piercing and
    splinter arrows in addition to each carrying one special affect.
    However, not all druids use these as they require mana to fletch,
    and the chance to affect a mob with the enchantments is rather low.
    Try using them and see if they suit your style.
    -   In order to create these a druid will need a natural fletching
        kit. To get these (for free), simply go and
        [Forage](Forage "wikilink") in any forest-terrain room. Natural
        fletching kits can also be used to fletch regular ammo, and
        druids can obtain infinite mounts of kits.
-   [Longshot](Longshot "wikilink") is useful when other archers aren't
    about - tie it to a trigger so group leader can use it effectively.
-   [Track](Track "wikilink"), [Blood Trail](Blood_Trail "wikilink") and
    [Bloodhound](Bloodhound "wikilink") allow for fast corpse and mob
    tracking.
-   [Anoint](Anoint "wikilink") is of marginal use, if you can remember
    that you have this skill.

### Devoting

Roixa is only a prerequisite to become a druid and is not mandated by
latter skills or spells. If you take into account that druids do
(usually) mediocre damage, some other worship may suit the healing roles
better.

Common choices are:

-   Roixa - best archery damage, poor buffing spells, mediocre healing,
-   Kra - halved archery damage (!), very good buffing spells, better
    healing,
-   Tul-Sith - bad archery, better buffing spells (worse than Kra), best
    healing.

See the [Worship](Worship "wikilink") and
[Devotion](Devotion "wikilink") tables for more details.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Soloing a druid is easily possible while using regular
archer gear and healing self. [Arrow Dodge](Arrow_Dodge "wikilink") will
help with otherwise dangerous bow-wielding mobs.

**Tanking:** Druids can tank as well as any archer, and can heal self
while at it. Keep in mind that unlike clerics they will not be able to
use a shield nor carry a held AC item, so their AC will be somewhat
lower than usual. The rescue is out-of-class; thus slow.

**Hitting:** Druids (generally) do more damage than a regular cleric and
run either in full HR gear, or use specialized [HR/mana
gear](:Category:Hero_Druid_Gear "wikilink"). While they hit they are
also able (and expected) to do:

**Healing:** while on the run. With cheap curatives they can sustain a
group for a long period of time using single-target and mass heals.
Druids can now use the spell [Awaken Staff](Awaken_Staff "wikilink") to
summon a spirit that will brandish staves, allowing them to continue
holding their arrows/bolts while brandishing.

## Druids at Lord Tier

At Lord tier the role of a druid changes little. They have access to
[Wall Of Thorns](Wall_Of_Thorns "wikilink") so they will be responsible
for keeping a group safe while regenerating, as well as healing the
group akin to any healer. With their mana comparable to clerics, druids
will be outhealed by priests but druid spell discounts will make them
last longer than vanilla clerics.

If idle during a lord run (which is rare), they can also use scattershot
or held shot with mixed results.

## Druid Remort Options

Druids can remort into [Priests](:Category:Priests "wikilink").

Racial remorts that make good druids are ones that give a [Racial
Archery Modifier](Racial_Archery_Modifier "wikilink") and/or good
spellcasting. [High Elves](High_Elf "wikilink"),
[Sprites](Sprites "wikilink") and [Tuataurs](Tuataurs "wikilink") are
good choices.
