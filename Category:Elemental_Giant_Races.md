*The Elemental Giants are subgroups of the [Giant](Giants.md "wikilink")
race that have somehow been imbued with Elemental magic. This Elemental
nature that permeates their being gives these Giants access to a variety
of unique abilities. It also allows Elemental Giants to cast more spells
before resting than ordinary Giants.*

*Despite their distinct nature, Elemental Giants share many similarities
with their more common cousins. All Giants are massive creatures that
are incredibly strong and extremely hardy. They all have a fondness of
eating corpses and they all excel at using two-handed weapons.*

*Like ordinary Giants, Elemental Giants are, generally speaking,
atrocious spell-casters. However, their Elemental nature allows them to
fare better than normal with certain specific types of magic. This
magical affinity means that Elemental Giants will have better success
when casting certain types of spells, and they will expend less magical
energy while doing so.*

*There is an important distinction between Elemental Giants and true
Elementals. True Elementals are entirely composed of their corresponding
element, be it Fire, Air, Earth, or Water. Elemental Giants remain
beings of flesh and blood.*
