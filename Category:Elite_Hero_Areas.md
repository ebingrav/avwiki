## Elite Areas

Elite Hero Areas (EHA) provide skilled players with additional
challenge. The enemies in these areas enjoy several advantages over
normal monsters, and give more experience than in normal areas.

Heroes who have reached sublevel 500 are able to practice
[eulogy](Eulogy "wikilink") and can transfer their corpse from an elite
hero area to [Sanctum](:Category:_Sanctum "wikilink"). The price for
this CR is steep.

Thanks to several [ corpse eaters](Corpse-Eating_Mobs "wikilink") and [
corpse animators](Corpse-Animating_Mobs "wikilink"), carrying
[Consecrated Ashes](Consecrated_Ashes "wikilink") and [Sulfurous
Ashes](Sulfurous_Ashes "wikilink") in your inventory can be helpful if
you die.

Note: Due to the potential rewards, there are significant risks
involved. Angels are forbidden from assisting heroes who venture into
these dangerous lands, for one!

**NOTE:** These areas are not worth much xp with less than four people
in a group and should be avoided by lower heroes.
