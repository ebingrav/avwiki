*There was a certain apprentice, by the name of Ma'Klyn, who resided in
a small shrine in the ancient High [Drow](Drow "wikilink") city. He was
so devoted to his worship that the Dark Fae Queen Zydarielle blessed
him, and enchanted the shrine. Whether through a dark twist of magic or
an accident, the remnants of the shrine were bound there. Small pieces
of each of the inhabitants are doomed to walk there forever, as shades.*
