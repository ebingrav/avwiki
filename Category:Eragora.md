*Ah! The lost, forgotten continent of Eragora on the eastern edges of
the Sea of Strayed Hopes. Unearthed due to seismic activity attributed
to the geomancer Tannah Machadae, this land is truly a sliver of time
straight from the past, populated for eons by warring half-orcs and
their slaves, the halflings. Eragora is only accessible by ferry, which
can be caught from the docks of Mervue.*

*NOTE: Spellbots are **not permitted** on Eragora. You must be at your
keyboard and viewing your Avatar screen to spell up others!*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eragora is a collection of areas that were part of a **[Hero Area
Building Contest](Area-Building_Contests.md "wikilink")**, initially
released in **May 2011**, as well as those areas produced afterwards.
Most of the areas are player made.

Eragora areas function using [**somewhat different
rules**](:Category:Eragora#Major_differences_versus_Midgaardia.md "wikilink")
than [the rest of Midgaardia](:Category:Midgaardia.md "wikilink"), [**be
sure to read about them
below**](:Category:Eragora#Major_differences_versus_Midgaardia.md "wikilink").

| [Sun God Altar](:Category:Sun_God_Altar.md "wikilink")             | All @ 750+                                 | Trivial CR, [more info](:Category:Sun_God_Altar#CR_info.md "wikilink"). | Read description for CR information. Otherwise Lairs equivalent.                                                  |

\(1\) Soloable represents the *technical* difficulty of a reasonable
solo caster (or other easily soloable-class) to explore all rooms, reach
all mobs, kill all mobs, and complete all quests (ie. explore and farm
gear). Some quests simply cannot be done by a single character due to
time or other constraints. You are of course the best judge of your own
capabilities so take these numbers only as a rough guideline. This does
**NOT** represent danger (death/gear-loss) of an area.

\(2\) With so many areas performing auto-CR and the statloss reduced by
50%, actual danger of Eragora is (and has always been) quite low. Only
some areas will require an involved CR, but it's nothing that a solo
character couldn't handle. However, to avoid deaths if you are small, do
read up on the areas you intend to run. As for the actual *dangers* of
the areas, a regular group will have little difficulty running all but
the hardest areas (bring a healer if required).

## Major differences versus Midgaardia

### 1. Transportation

Players are not expected to travel between Midgaardia (and its
[Sanctum](:Category:Sanctum.md "wikilink")!) and Eragora often due to
relatively high (material) costs involved and time required to cross the
ocean. One **cannot** teleport/portal/nexus between Eragora and
Midgaardia.

Transportation spells will function normally once in Eragora proper,
i.e., past the [gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate.md "wikilink"), and will
function only within Eragora proper.

Lords are able to [homeshift](Homeshift.md "wikilink") from Eragora and
then [planeshift](Planeshift.md "wikilink") back onto Midgaardia, but
this is only a method of exiting, not entering Eragora.

### 2. [Eragora Default Recall](Eragora_Default_Recall "wikilink")

Eragora is a separate continent and has a separate default recall point.
It is positioned in the middle of [Eragora
Walkways](:Category:Eragora_Walkways.md "wikilink")
([map](Eragora_Walkways_Map.md "wikilink")) - basically the center of
all Eragora, and is an infirmary and safe.

Some areas are non-recallable. This means a player can recall to them,
and within them, but not out of them, functioning oppositely to cursed
rooms.

### 3. Spells and Bots

Spellbots are forbidden on Eragora. Players desiring to explore Eragoran
areas should have means to self-spell, or should rely on other players
for their spells.

The process of crossing the [gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate.md "wikilink")
into Eragora proper will [ablute](Ablution.md "wikilink") the player.
Thus, it is impossible to import spells from bots in
[Sanctum](:Category:Sanctum.md "wikilink"), for example.

For soloing players, all Eragoran areas may be more difficult to handle
than their Midgaardian level-based counterparts due to (generally) lower
AC and missing spells from self-spelling. Prepare accordingly.

### 4. Local Clouds and Auto-CR

Every Eragoran area has an unique local cloud - a death room where the
player spawns after he dies. These clouds are always within the area
where the player died, a feature first encountered in areas such as
[Graves of Reveria](:Category:Graves_Of_Reveria.md "wikilink").

Akin to Graves, some areas (about a half of them) will also move the
player corpse to the player into that local cloud room - thus performing
Auto-CR. This behavior is largely area-dependent and should be read
about in advance at specific area pages.

One thing to be wary of is that some of these death rooms are
anti-magic, and often accessible only on death. Players with overloaded
corpses (either very heavy items (weight limit) or very many items (item
limit) will not be able to cast [giant
strength](Giant_Strength.md "wikilink") (for strength) or [adrenaline
pump](Adrenaline_Pump.md "wikilink") (for dexterity) and retrieve all
gear.

*Tip:* If this happens to you, donate excess gear, relog to an alt and
retrieve the excess gear from donation room in Sanctum. Alternatively,
try switching gear sets to see if any of your gear has a strength or
dexterity bonus on it. Some players deliberately include an item of
statistic boosting gear in their gear sets or bags for situations like
this.

### 5. Eragora Affects

[Hand of God](Hog.md "wikilink") is permanently disabled on Eragora.

Eragora currently has +10% Experience bonus, and statloss is reduced by
50%.

## Getting to Eragora

### Primary Method

Go to [Ent's Bank](Banker.md "wikilink") and withdraw an amethyst (slow
transport) or a catseye (rapid transport). Go 4s and give the gem you
chose to [Charon](Charon "wikilink"), which will take you over the sea
on his ferry. Be sure your entire group is in Charon's room since once
the ferry takes off anyone left behind will need to pay for another
trip. The passengers need not be grouped to be taken across, just be in
the same room.

Once you arrive, you will be at [Sphynx
Gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate.md "wikilink"). This is the
starting/introductory/philosophical area, that may warrant attention for
some players.

Move one south and all eastwards to encounter the twin Sphynx. See the
[Sphynx Gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate.md "wikilink") info to help you
survive the process of entering Eragora proper (in short, send largest
characters first to clear the other - potentially aggie - side).

Note that upon entering Eragora you will receive the temporary insignia
[A trauma upon your spirit](A_trauma_upon_your_spirit "wikilink"), which
will prevent you from leaving Eragora via the usual method (until it
expires, which isn't too long).

### Secondary Method

**Note**: *Questing is required to enable this.*

Those with access to means to draw divine attention to themselves may be
able to use the aging deity's frail eyesight and trick them into
intercontinental travel. To do this one needs to reach a place of power
on Eragora - a nexus of divine energies.

This method is as instantaneous as it is safe.

## Escaping Eragora

Getting through the [Sphynx Gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate.md "wikilink")
is trivial, getting out may not be for many.

*Primary method:* The easiest way used to be to portal to [Rainbow
Plant](Rainbow_Plant "wikilink"), which is a stationary
(non-agggressive) mob 2e from the gate – however there are now other
mobs with the same name, some of which are not portable. Try 2.rainbow,
3.rainbow, etc. The portal should go to "The base of an emergent tree".
You may be aggied by a wandering mob so prepare accordingly (be spelled
or have other players to help you). You can also walk from [Eragora
Default Recall](Eragora_Default_Recall "wikilink") fairly easily (check
the [Eragora Walkways Map](Eragora_Walkways_Map "wikilink")).

*Alternative method:* A secondary portal point is [Guardian of
Eragora](Guardian_of_Eragora "wikilink"), an aggressive mob which roams
the [Rhuien Forest](:Category:Rhuien_Forest.md "wikilink"). Look portal
before entering since there is another (also aggressive) guardian in
[Halfling's Paradise](:Category:Halfling's_Paradise.md "wikilink"). If
the portal shown describes a forest, you have portalled to the correct
one. Sneak, go westwards and consult
[map](Rhuien_Forest_Map.md "wikilink") on the quickest way out.

*Secondary method:* *Questing is required to enable this.* Those with
access to means to draw divine attention to themselves may be able to
use the aging deity's frail eyesight and trick them into
intercontinental travel. To do this one needs to reach a place of power
on Midgaardia, related to the deity with poor eyesight. This method is
as instantaneous as it is safe.

*Lords:* [Homeshift](Homeshift "wikilink").

**If the twin Sphynx do not react when you enter their room, you are
invisible.** Become visible, exit (go east) and enter again (go west).

If successful, you will emerge back in the Sphynx Gate area, from where
go all westwards and then one south to meet [Kharon](Kharon "wikilink").
Say "Mervue" and he will ferry you to Mervue, Midgaardia.

## Navigation

Most of the Eragoran areas are connected to the [Eragora
Walkways](:Category:Eragora_Walkways.md "wikilink"), which serves as a
connector area. Among exceptions is the [Sphynx
Gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate.md "wikilink"), which connects to the
[Rhuien Forest](:Category:Rhuien_Forest.md "wikilink"), which in turn
connects to the Eragora Walkways.

Navigation within the continent functions normally, but non-lords lack
means to exit the continent, except via the Sphynx Gate where they came
in. Eragora has no access to Sanctum, the Cloud or other Midgaardian
necessities - see above for details.

## Adventuring

Areas are not designed to accommodate mortals or low heroes due to a
lack of trainers, issues with self-spelling, and average mob size.
However, in groups and with spellup characters, even lowhero groups can
run the less-dangerous areas of Eragora.

Self-spelling and spelling via spellup alts means a different tempo of
running than most players are used to. General Eragoran difficulty will
depend on the party composition - a diverse group is likely to fare
well.

You can see what players are currently in Eragora with the command 'who
zone'.
