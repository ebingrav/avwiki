*From the western edge of the Eragoran continent, through the surging
river which bisects the land, and to the immeasurable mountain range in
the east - mysteries will begin to unravel, as day shatters into bits of
night.*

recall](Eragora_default_recall "wikilink"): stand still.

multiple aggies along the way.

[Lookout](Lookout "wikilink") (aggressive, hard hitting, and there are 7

## Navigation

Navigation is trivial as the area consists of four linear branches
connecting various Eragoran areas. One cannot get lost, and even if one
succeeds at such a task, use the default recall to go to the middle of
the area.

## Adventuring

Area is filled with an even ratio of aggressive and non-aggressive
wandering mobs. None hit too hard and some carry decent wields. Ideal
for casters to solo or lowhero groups to run through. Mob density is
average.

Trees are aggressive.

Area is uncursed with the exception of the local cloud, so recall is
possible from any point.

The local cloud room is anti-magic and safe (you can save spells in this
room). [Eragora default recall](Eragora_default_recall "wikilink") is an
infirmary, though not safe - save spells in the cloud room. Both rooms
are nomob, so you will be free from pestering, but also no-quit, so only
convenient to regenerate and spell up.

Unlike some other Eragoran areas, Eragora Walkways will not do your CR
for you.
