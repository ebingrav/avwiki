*The Illuminati have made a portal from their home world to ours with
the intention of ruling Midgaardia! Luckily for us, they made their
portal a little too close to the Erisian Temple in
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink"), and the acolytes of the
[Goddess Eris](Goddess_Eris "wikilink") have so far managed to to hold
them back.*
