*Some people take longer to fully express their potential than others.
In addition to [training](Train "wikilink")
[attributes](:Category:_Statistics "wikilink") and
[practicing](Practice "wikilink") new [spells and
skills](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink"), it is possible for
some [races](:Category:_Races "wikilink") to evolve into more advanced
creatures during their leveling progress. Such evolution is accomplished
with the [evolve](Evolve "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") and is voluntary. After a
successful [evolving](Evolve "wikilink") you may find you're better than
you were before: better - stronger - faster! Or you may find, that you
are just - different, having undergone a radical metamorphosis.*

*In particular, the [firedrake](Firedrakes "wikilink") race is known to
evolve from a hatchling of moderate destructive potential into a
fearsome beast. There are rumours that link the despised
[Lesser](Lesser_Imps "wikilink") and [Minor](Minor_Imps "wikilink")
[Imps](Imps "wikilink") to some greater beings, but it seems hardly
believable.*

*Note: A previous evolutionary race, [Verbit](Verbit "wikilink"), has
been discontinued. [Verbit](Verbit "wikilink") characters are allowed
and encouraged to rebuild to [Imps](Imps "wikilink").*
