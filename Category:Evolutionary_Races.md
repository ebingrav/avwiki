*Some people take longer to fully express their potential than others.
In addition to [training](Train.md "wikilink")
[attributes](:Category:_Statistics.md "wikilink") and
[practicing](Practice.md "wikilink") new [spells and
skills](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink"), it is possible for
some [races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") to evolve into more
advanced creatures during their leveling progress. Such evolution is
accomplished with the [evolve](Evolve.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") and is voluntary. After a
successful [evolving](Evolve.md "wikilink") you may find you're better
than you were before: better - stronger - faster! Or you may find, that
you are just - different, having undergone a radical metamorphosis.*

*In particular, the [firedrake](Firedrakes.md "wikilink") race is known
to evolve from a hatchling of moderate destructive potential into a
fearsome beast. There are rumours that link the despised
[Lesser](Lesser_Imps.md "wikilink") and
[Minor](Minor_Imps.md "wikilink") [Imps](Imps "wikilink") to some
greater beings, but it seems hardly believable.*

*Note: A previous evolutionary race, [Verbit](Verbit "wikilink"), has
been discontinued. [Verbit](Verbit "wikilink") characters are allowed
and encouraged to rebuild to [Imps](Imps "wikilink").*
