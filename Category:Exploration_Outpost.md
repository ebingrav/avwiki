**Level Range:** 51-51

**Builder:** Ginta

This area was added in August 2011.

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [Ginormous
Dingersen](Ginormous_Dingersen "wikilink").

## Directions

Walking route from [Eragora Default
Recall](Eragora_Default_Recall "wikilink"): 2s d 2s e 3s w s w s w 2s w
2u.

## Connections

-   [ Eragora Walkways](:Category:_Eragora_Walkways "wikilink")

## Navigation

The area is made of the following major parts:

-   The "top" layer, where Ginormous, Mayflower, Pilgrim and other
    supporting mobs/questgivers exist,
-   The sea proper, a 4x4x2.5 block with fish, eels and other sea
    creatures,
-   The elemental caves with .. elementals and imps, to the east of the
    sea proper,
-   The sunken ship, as the primary quest location, underneath the sea.
    The ship is no-regen, so no camping there.
-   The kelp forest, south of the sea, with **tons** of kelp and
    fantastic xp, but a maze, though not a large one.

## Adventuring

If you have a proper group, use a 101+ hero to start Ginormous' [main
quest](Deep-Sea_Diver_Quest "wikilink"), which will net you a
**permahero** insignia once completed (you can choose either +3% to
melee or +3% to spell power). The quest involves the ship and is not
trivial. You will need two big tanks and several area spellers surging
high, and also might require some regen time between boss mobs.

[Another quest](Safety_Award_Quest "wikilink") involves Pilgrim and the
extermination of sharks, which will give a weekly boost of +5% xp for
all included, and is much easier than the main quest. Any standard group
will suffice.

However, if the area is run for xp, you will want to focus on the
southern part of the sea - with the kelp farms, which when ran with a
wizard in group (especially multicaster/bld combo groups) will make low
TNL groupies level once per room (meaning *very* very fast). 18k xp runs
are not unheard of here.

Gear running will likely focus on the elementals, but they load gear
only 50% of time. The ship has some powerful gear as well, but soloing
the ship is very dangerous even for lord casters. Liberal amounts of
calming and swift fingers might be required.

## Comments

There is *no longer* a bank e n of Ginormous. All of the top layer is
safe. Follow Mayflower to get down to the bulk of the area.

-   Eels are aggie but can't see hidden. However, same as all aggie
    mobs, they assist when move hidden temporarily falls during fights.
-   The turtles skin for [shards of
    ulexite](Shard_Of_Ulexite "wikilink"). Giving this to the goblin e,
    n of Ginormous will cast atheist imm steel on you. They can also be
    sold as treasure.
-   If small, avoid the ship, it can get very nasty and swarmy.
-   The elementals are very tough but can be soloed by "most" 999
    heroes, "most" of the time. They will load their gear only 50% of
    the time though.

Outpost will do Auto-CR for you, unless you die of eel poison,
self-disintegration or similar nastiness. Once you die, **enter
window**, and you will end up at *Explorer's Respite*, your corpse at
your feet.

The fountain in Ginormous's room casts regenerate (quaff for it!).
