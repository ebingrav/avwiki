*The planar shift into Arcadia drops into the middle of a beautiful
eldritch forest where dreams grow on trees and daydreams flow down the
river.*

*Unfortunately, according to Astra, the Fae are xenophobes of the worst
kind and will view the Midgaardian Lords' intrusion as we might a plague
of locusts. The Fae have set Balefire to the woods, trying to erase the
"Midgaardian Stain" from their fair plane.*

## Directions

[Planeshift](Planeshift "wikilink") to
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia.md "wikilink").

If you're not confident in your ability to survive a swarm at
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia.md "wikilink") shift, you can
[Planeshift](Planeshift "wikilink") to
[Astral](:Category:Astral.md "wikilink"), go 3d (be careful with the
golems) and portal to a chim or bale. However, be warned that the astral
shift consists of three Astral Guardians who hit harder than they used
to and calming may be required to move. Previously, going 3d from shift
was a relatively simple task insofar as the bottom of the citadel was
sparsely populated and finding a place to portal to the forest, or
alternatively to sleep w n d from the room below the golem was
straightforward. In late 2014, the area's mobs were changed to move more
frequently (sometimes stacking as high as 5 below the golems) and the
citadel guardians, who previously only fired stun arrows if they
happened upon a player, can now longshot - effectively a death sentence,
as they will track you and finish you off (lag is 10 seconds per shot).
The Arcadian shift sometimes features only one mob and is by no means
difficult for a burly soloer to negotiate, but this is a rare occurrence
indeed; shifts with as much as 5-6 chimeras are not uncommon. In
general, the forest is a poor area to solo, with mob values having
dropped due to recent coding changes that favor group xp (true of all
other areas also). In the case of a group, the safest rooms to regen are
in the northeast/northwest portions with balefire beasts on scan in at
least two rooms. Even then, walkins do occasionally occur. Northeast of
shift is the official entrance to citadel arcadia, protected by two
sturdy gate guards. These two are soloable with, for instance, a dragon
caster, but this is no easy task and recruiting a monk or warrior to
tank them is a smarter option. North of them is the hedge maze which is
linear, but has drifting smoke ixupis (with painful area spells) and
lightning arrow-wielding guardians (who can now longshot). The keys for
the remainder of the area are on a variety of guards (still to be
identified).

## Connections

Connects to [Citadel Arcadia](:Category:Citadel_Arcadia.md "wikilink").
From shift go *all* n until you reach the gates. Other ways to get there
include portalling to [Fae Gate Guard](Fae_Gate_Guard "wikilink") or
taking the walking route from [Astral](:Category:Astral.md "wikilink")
(mentioned above).

Also connects to [Dark Fae
Tower](:Category:Dark_Fae_Tower.md "wikilink"). To get there walk west
from shift seeking water rooms on scan. Once you find the river, stay on
it, and follow it southwards to a waterfall.

## Navigation

## Adventuring

This area is great for running exp. The lowest amount of people
recommended in a group is 4; for meaningful experience, and assuming
you're staying in Fantasy Forest and not running gear in the Citadel,
keep the group under 10 people. It is possible to solo some chimeras if
you're a sturdy caster, but they do hit hard, some use annoying psion
spells like Migraine and Scramble, and you can't guarantee that you
won't have a walk-in. Moreover, the shift can be rough on hp's, so if
you plan to solo/duo with a lower hp partner, do the astral shift
instead (though with 3 armed guardians, that one isn't much easier) and
portal chim.

The [Balefire Beasts](Balefire_Beast "wikilink") are sentinel and level
160. Therefore the safest places to sleep in this area are where you can
see two rooms of them on scan. An emberling or two wanders around here,
a mob for immolation. Balefires are evil, and a good way to fix align
after a glyph run. In addition, an Ixupi or two wanders around the
Balefires and the maze.
