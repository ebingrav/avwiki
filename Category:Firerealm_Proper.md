*The realm of fire is a place devoid of all caring and compassion for
life. Eternally burning for conquest of new worlds, the Lord of the Fire
elementals has left his realms secrets protected by fearsome guardians
which defend it from a cruel order of priests, bent on cleansing
wickedness and sloth from every world, as well as any other outsiders.*

The Fire shift is extremely tame granted you have no Flame Crusaders.
Usually takes 1-2 tanks only. The Great Inferno subarea, as well as the

Lost/Flame Crusaders will disarm and a Ember Hulk/Crusader room can be
extremely nasty for your weapons.
