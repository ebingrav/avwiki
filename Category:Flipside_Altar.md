*Long, long ago (some say even before
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink") was built), amid an
ancient and mighty forest, there stood a Temple to the Demon Deity
Glasya. The Ancient Text "God, Deities and Devils, from Amon to Zuul"
describes Glasya as a demonic corruption of nature. Occasionally
Glasya's Priests would cause trees to transform into hideous monsters
and attack nearby villages. The Greater Gods were displeased with
Glasya, and as a punishment, turned over the earth upon which Glasya's
temple and the surrounding forest stood. Its upside down temple banished
forever beneath the surface, Glasya's influence disappeared from this
World.*
