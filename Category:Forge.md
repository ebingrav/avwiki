*The end of the world is coming, some predict. Others are certain that
it has already taken root at the edge of Wildwood. Overlooking those
fields of destruction, an engine of war wreathed in fire and smoke has
toiled tirelessly for untold generations. Its masters have bided their
time undisturbed as they amass an army, preparing for a war that has yet
to come.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

**Builder:** Scevine

## Directions

Walking route from [Terrified Woman](Terrified_Woman "wikilink"): w, 2n,
2w, 2n

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [White
Raven](White_Raven_Alighting_Unseen "wikilink").

## Connections

-   [Apocalypse](Apocalypse "wikilink")
    ([map](Apocalypse_Map "wikilink"))

## Navigation

The first few rooms of the area are nospell. The rest of the area all
seems to allow spellcasting. The area is probably norecall (didn't try
most rooms) but permits teleporting out.

The layout is fairly straightforward; see [Forge
Map](Forge_Map "wikilink"). Once you get inside, there are four main
levels -- upstairs, midlevel around the forge, downstairs, and a small
pool of slag.

It was possible to map every room in the area with a superhero dwarf
fusilier with liberal use of intervention, flee, calm, quit, and
teleport. It was also possible to kill almost every mob (discovered so
far) at least once with a solo fusilier, with the exception of the
Questmaster, Forgemistress Luninia, and the mobs in "Overlooking
Midgaardia's Doom!". The large sanced giants pose a challenge,
especially the annihilator.

Key rooms in this area seem to include:

-   Outside - White Raven's room - is safe and is a great portal point.
    The target has move hidden, so beware.
-   Top floor - Above the mouth of the furnace - throw buckets of ore
    into the furnace from here
-   Top floor - An exposed vein of hematite - gray ore and Ferromancer
    Cindris - this is part of a mineshaft that leads to the middle floor
-   Middle floor - Fuel for the fire - hidden ent mobile with name
    "movement"
-   Middle floor - An exposed vein of magnetite - Tiny mini-maze mine
    leads to Ferromancer Ignicar (lodestone) and the bucket of black ore
-   Bottom level - Inferno! - room can only be entered if your alignment
    is evil, can spawn mobs here by dropping lumber, mobs will yield
    charcoal on death
-   Bottom level - Pools of iron - a mob may be spawned here if you drop
    buckets of ore upstairs
-   Bottom level - Heartstone-adjacent rooms with Forgemistress Luninia
    (weapon quest?), Forgemaster Pyristor (bucket of iron scale),
    Artificer Coruscianus (lodestone recipient, crown of war)
-   Below-the-bottom pools of slag - Ferromancer Sturmiet (carries a
    severed giant head) wanders here, beware of corpse-eating slagslugs!

## Adventuring

It seems that you can safely set recall in the room with White Raven.
He's hidden, so have detects up. This is 3 rooms into the area.

Or:

One room south of the entrance is an un-cursed room in
[Apocalypse](Apocalypse "wikilink"), so recall can be set there. Be
careful as [War](War "wikilink") is just to the west. The entrance
(first) room of the area is also un-cursed so recall can be set there as
well, however it is not safe so aggressive mobs sometimes wander in.

The area is of course swarmy, being an
[EHA](:Category:Elite_Hero_Areas "wikilink"), so be prepared. The [Red
Skinned Orcs](Red_Skinned_Orc "wikilink") are big and hit hard; when
soloed they give 200-250xp, not nearly worth it for the pain they cause.

This area has a few types of mobs and particularly interesting areas:

### Orcs

The area is full of orcs. Sometimes one will carry [Red Glowing
Dust](Red_Glowing_Dust "wikilink"); it's not clear what triggers more
dust to spawn (possibly killing all of them in the area?).

Killing all the orcs in the area entrance spawns a new mob, [a landslide
of red stone](a_landslide_of_red_stone "wikilink"), which chases and
attacks you.

Orcs include a red skinned orc and an ill tempered orc, perhaps others.

### Giants

The area is full of giants. Some wield weapons, some cast spells, some
carry "an ordinary pile of lumber" (usable in Inferno!) or "a red bucket
of ore" (can be dropped in "Above the mouth of the furnace" for a
message but no other obvious effect). Some have sanctuary and wield
weapons.

Various giants include a laboring fire giant, a tireless fire giant, a
mountain giant (sentinel in the last nospell room near the entrance), a
fire giant shrouded in smoke, a cinder mage, a driven fire giant, a fire
giant soldier, a fire giant steel warrior, a fire giant ironseer (shows
a message when killed but no other apparent effects?), and a a fearsome
fire giant. They're mostly worth about 400 xp solo. Others are:

-   A fire giant annihilator is large, sanced, and can go berserk (is
    worth \~1800 xp solo after reboot), carries an unfinished red hot
    sword as well as an untakeable on-body item (sarcophagus). Not sure
    whether the corpse skins.
-   Leveler Adamas is large and sanced and a berserker; he wields [a
    length of red hot chain](a_length_of_red_hot_chain "wikilink"), is
    worth about 1448 xp solo after reboot, and can be skinned for [a
    strip of burnt, tattooed
    flesh](a_strip_of_burnt,_tattooed_flesh "wikilink").
-   A fire giant iron warrior is sanced and carries [iron tower
    shield](iron_tower_shield "wikilink") and [cold iron
    halo](cold_iron_halo "wikilink").
-   A fire maiden is not sanced but hits pretty hard and drops a [pool
    of fire giant blood](pool_of_fire_giant_blood "wikilink") on death.

Reportedly at least one of the giants (Leveler Adamas?) can eat corpses.

### Ironbeasts

The pools of iron downstairs contain ironbeasts, who hit hard; these
rooms are water, so it's hard to flee. The area can also spawn "a newly
formed ironbeast" or "a terrible ironfiend" if you drop certain buckets
in the mouth room upstairs.

### Slagslugs

The very bottom 2x3 level "Trudging through piles of slag" contains both
Ferromancer Sturmiet and also several slagslugs. These eat corpses. The
area is water, so it's hard to flee.

### White Raven

White Raven is in the area's entrance in a relatively safe room (Against
sheer mesa cliffs). His description says that he wants souls.

He will trade:

-   [Red Glowing Dust](Red_Glowing_Dust "wikilink") for [Red Glowing
    Dust, Remixed](Red_Glowing_Dust,_Remixed "wikilink") (adds cure
    serious)
-   [the radiant soul of a fire
    giant](the_radiant_soul_of_a_fire_giant "wikilink") (level 1000
    unsaveable trash item, item spawned on ground after killing terrible
    ironfiend, which is spawned in the "Pools of iron" rooms by dropping
    bucket of iron scale in "Above the mouth of the furnace"; bucket of
    iron scale is carried by Forgemaster Pyristor in "The shadow of a
    burning throne") -- trades for Corona of Fire insignia, which is -8%
    death xp reduction (INCREASED death xp loss), +1 damroll,
    insignificant increase in fire resistance, and is incompatible with
    Fiery Aura/Fiery Nimbus
-   [the glowing soul of a fire
    giant](the_glowing_soul_of_a_fire_giant "wikilink") (saveable item,
    item spawned on ground after killing a newly formed ironbeast, which
    is spawned in "Pools of iron" after dropping bucket of gray ore in
    "Above the mouth of the furnace"; bucket of gray ore spawns on the
    ground in Cindris's room "An exposed vein of hematite") -- trades
    for Fiery Aura insignia, which is +15% death xp reduction, +2% hp
    regeneration, modifies melee attacks with fire damage, and is
    incompatible with Corona of Fire/Fiery Nimbus
-   [the pulsing soul of a fire
    giant](the_pulsing_soul_of_a_fire_giant "wikilink") (saveable item,
    item spawned on ground after killing a newly formed ironbeast, which
    is spawned in "Pools of iron" after dropping bucket of black ore in
    "Above the mouth of the furnace"; bucket of black ore spawns on the
    ground in Ignicar's room "An exposed vein of magnetite") -- trades
    for Fiery Nimbus insignia, which is +15% death xp reduction, +2%
    mana regeneration, modifies melee attacks with fire damage, and is
    incompatible with Corona of Fire/Fiery Aura
-   [the burning soul of a fire
    giant](the_burning_soul_of_a_fire_giant "wikilink") -- carried by
    Loqui Incendris Flegathrix who is accessed by giving the crown of
    war (from Coruscianus) to War -- trades for Coruscating Fire
    insignia, which is -12% death xp reduction (INCREASED death xp
    loss), +2 hitroll, +2 damroll, insignificantly increases resistance
    to fire continuous
-   [strip of burnt tattooed
    flesh](strip_of_burnt_tattooed_flesh "wikilink") from skinning
    Leveler Adamas -- he won't accept this but gives a hint.
-   [the severed head of a
    giant](the_severed_head_of_a_giant "wikilink") from Sturmiet -- he
    won't accept this but gives a hint.

At least one of the Corona of Fire/Fiery Aura/Fiery Nimbus insignias was
observed to drop within a week with 0 deaths and 0 levels gained (the
insignia remained but all its effects faded). Others report that the
Coruscating Fire insignia seems to last indefinitely (no time limit, but
may have a death limit).

In this room, you can drop:

-   [Pool Of Fire Giant Blood](Pool_Of_Fire_Giant_Blood "wikilink"),
    kill spawn item from fire maiden -- generates a temporary portal in
    this room with keyword "fissure". The fissure portal sometimes goes
    to "Above the mouth of the furnace" (Pyristor's room) and sometimes
    leads to a "A work path carved along the pit wall" on the second
    level, from which you can walk west,south "Fuel for the fire".
-   [strip of burnt tattooed
    flesh](strip_of_burnt_tattooed_flesh "wikilink") and then a [Heart
    of Fire](Heart_of_Fire "wikilink") to yield [Leveler
    Tattoos](Leveler_Tattoos "wikilink") on the ground.
-   [the severed head of a
    giant](the_severed_head_of_a_giant "wikilink") and then a [Heart of
    Fire](Heart_of_Fire "wikilink") to yield a [Scorched Giant
    Skull](Scorched_Giant_Skull "wikilink") on the ground.

### Inferno!

This room can only be accessed if your alignment is evil (no good, no
neutral). If you drop [a pile of ordinary
lumber](a_pile_of_ordinary_lumber "wikilink") or [a pile of entish
lumber](a_pile_of_entish_lumber "wikilink") the room will cause a
moderate amount of room damage and spawn a level 57 mob called [The
blazing inferno](The_blazing_inferno "wikilink"). On death, the mob
drops an item of type ticket, [pure charcoal](pure_charcoal "wikilink").
If you used entish lumber it has flags "good"; if you used ordinary
lumber it has flags "evil". This room is noregen.

### Forgemistress Luninia

This mob is in a room with an invisible mob named [The Forge
Questmaster](The_Forge_Questmaster "wikilink") who hits at least 6 times
per round for obliterating damage through sanctuary. Trying to kill
Luninia caused this mob to attack, but it's unclear whether she can be
killed.

When handed an object of type weapon she will sometimes say

` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'THIS WEAPON... IS FINISHED. NO NEED TO REFINE IT.'`  
` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'ENJOY THE KILLING.'`

and gives the weapon back. She says this for the [Forge
Hammer](Forge_Hammer "wikilink") and [Titanic Iron
Gauntlet](Titanic_Iron_Gauntlet "wikilink") and [Chained
Morningstar](Chained_Morningstar "wikilink").

Sometimes instead she will say

` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'THIS WEAPON... IS TERRIBLE. AS GOOD AS IT WILL EVER BE.'`  
` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'WHICH IS STILL... TERRIBLE.'`

and gives the weapon back. She says this for [Studded Iron
Knuckles](Studded_Iron_Knuckles "wikilink"), [staff tipped with gobs of
molten iron and
slag](staff_tipped_with_gobs_of_molten_iron_and_slag "wikilink"), and
[length of red hot chain](length_of_red_hot_chain "wikilink").

When handed an object that is not of type weapon (such as an [Adamantite
Halo](Adamantite_Halo "wikilink") or [Red hot iron
staff](Red_hot_iron_staff "wikilink")) she will keep it, and good luck
getting it back since she seems to be hard to kill.

When handed [unfinished, red hot
sword](unfinished,_red_hot_sword "wikilink") from [a fire giant
annihilator](a_fire_giant_annihilator "wikilink") she instead says:

` Forgemistress Luninia examnines the red hot sword, checking for quality.`  
` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'FIRE BAD!  ...  FOR STEELMAKING.'`  
` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'FOR BEST STEEL  ...  NEED FUEL. MORE PURE.'`  
` Forgemistress Luninia gives you unfinished, red hot sword.`

When handed wood (ordinary lumber or entish lumber) she says

` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'WOOD... TERRIBLE FUEL FOR FINERY!'`  
` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'LAST GIANT WHO GAVE ME LUMBER FOR FIRE... I FED TO STORMY ONE.'`  
` Forgemistress Luninia snarls 'ONLY CHARCOAL. IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEAD.'`

When handed charcoal she says

` You give pure charcoal to Forgemistress Luninia.`  
` Luminia drops the fuel into her forge, and stokes the fire. The flames`  
` turn a searing white with each pump of the bellows.`  
` Forgemistress Luninia gives you a wicked, fanged grin as the flames lick the edge of the anvil!`  
` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'NOW... READY TO FINISH WEAPON.'`

Then when handed a sword she says

` You give unfinished, red hot sword to Forgemistress Luninia.`  
` Forgemistress Luninia examines the red hot sword, checking for quality.`  
` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'SWORD IS GOOD STEEL. BUT NEEDS PROPER EDGE.'`  
` Forgemistress Luninia roars 'STAY HERE... WHILE I WORK.'`  
` Forgemistress Luninia quenches the sword in the trough of water beside her.`  
` Forgemistress Luninia has created a blast of steam!`  
` Forgemistress Luninia has created a blast of steam!`  
` Forgemistress Luninia sets the sword upon her anvil and sets to work.`  
` [time passes, steam attacks]`  
` *BWONNNG* *BWONNNG* A drum sounds in the distance, rousing the giants`  
` from their work. It looks like they're on to you. Took them long enough. `  
` [giants enter the room and kill you]`

It seems like she probably offers a quest weapon of some type if you
survive the onslaught of steam and giants, possibly with its alignment
or stats differing based on whether you use charcoal from an ent or from
ordinary lumber.

### Ferromancers and myrmidons

The area has several Ferromancers, generally non-aggressive mobs, who
are generally guarded by [Fire Giant
Myrmidons](Fire_Giant_Myrmidon "wikilink"), aggressive mobs who wear a
flametongue-charged [Ember Shield](Ember_Shield "wikilink") and wield a
[Fire Lance](Fire_Lance "wikilink").

Some of the ferromancers carry various quest-related items or
weapons/armor.

These include:

-   Ferromancer Cindris : in a room with a bucket of gray ore. Carries
    [Fan Of Adamantine Darts](Fan_Of_Adamantine_Darts "wikilink")
    (throwing weapon which does area damage) plus a [Fiery Horned
    Sallet](Fiery_Horned_Sallet "wikilink"), [Liquid Iron
    Cape](Liquid_Iron_Cape "wikilink"), [Titanic Iron
    Gauntlet](Titanic_Iron_Gauntlet "wikilink") (10/10 clawing +earth
    damage +fire resist -water resist). Likes to cast flash, worth about
    1000 xp solo. He's guarded by a [Fire Giant
    Myrmidon](Fire_Giant_Myrmidon "wikilink").
-   Ferromancer Embriglius : in the room where you drop ore buckets.
    Doesn't carry anything special (a [Fiery Horned
    Sallet](Fiery_Horned_Sallet "wikilink") and [Liquid Iron
    Cape](Liquid_Iron_Cape "wikilink")), doesn't skin. Guarded by a
    [Fire Giant Myrmidon](Fire_Giant_Myrmidon "wikilink").
-   Ferromancer Ignicar : in a room with a bucket of black ore. Wears a
    [Fiery Horned Sallet](Fiery_Horned_Sallet "wikilink") and a [Liquid
    Iron Cape](Liquid_Iron_Cape "wikilink"), carries a
    [lodestone](Lodestone_(Forge) "wikilink"). Guarded by a [Fire Giant
    Myrmidon](Fire_Giant_Myrmidon "wikilink").
-   Ferromancer Sturmiet : holds the [Severed Head Of A
    Giant](Severed_Head_Of_A_Giant "wikilink"), doesn't skin. Surrounded
    by corpse-eating slagslugs but is not guarded by a myrmidon. Casts
    thunderhead, is aggressive.
-   Forgemaster Pyristor : in "The shadow of a burning throne". No known
    quest responsibilities. Carries a bucket of iron scale, which can be
    dropped in the forge mouth to spawn a large iron monster. Worth 700
    xp solo. Carries a [Forge Hammer](Forge_Hammer "wikilink").
-   Artificer Coruscianus : in the southern "The mouth of a searing
    forge". Wears [Adamantine Halo](Adamantine_Halo "wikilink") and
    wields [Forge Hammer](Forge_Hammer "wikilink") and carries the
    [Crown Of War](Crown_Of_War "wikilink"), a ticket good for one-way
    transport to a very large room. Will trade a
    [lodestone](Lodestone_(Forge) "wikilink") and other goods for a
    [Chained Morningstar](Chained_Morningstar "wikilink") (might he make
    other weapons if you had other things in your inventory - like the
    elemental armbands quest?).

### Overlooking Midgaardia's Doom

Giving "the crown of war" from Artificer Coruscianus to
[War](War "wikilink") in [Apocalypse](Apocalypse "wikilink") teleports
you to a room with no exits but a portal and some very large mobs:

` You give the crown of war to War.`  
`   "Fools! War needs no crown to prove his power!" the demon answers`  
`    in a booming voice. "But if you wish to challenge that bauble's`  
`    rightful owner, I will grant you your wish for death. In truth, it`  
`    is a fight I wish to see for myself!"`  
` `  
` Without warning the world starts to tilt around you, in the way that the`  
` world distinctly SHOULD NOT. The pedestal of War drifts up and over your`  
` head, and the horizon spins. Before you know it, you are plummeting down`  
` toward a fiery vortex that cleaves the sky in two!`  
` `  
` As you pass through the vortex and start to feel your skin peeling off,`  
` the sight of a familiar mesa top fades into view...`

This room (Overlooking Midgaardia's Doom) contains a [Fire
Maiden](Fire_Maiden "wikilink"), a [Cinder
Mage](Cinder_Mage "wikilink"), and a [Fire Giant
Myrmidon](Fire_Giant_Myrmidon "wikilink"), all carrying their normal
complement of gear plus an [Iron Ring](Iron_Ring "wikilink") and a
[Heart of Fire](Heart_of_Fire "wikilink"). It also contains [Loqui
Incendris Flegathrix](Loqui_Incendris_Flegathrix "wikilink"), who has a
ring, a heart, the [Burning Soul of a Fire
Giant](Burning_Soul_of_a_Fire_Giant "wikilink"), and other items.

The room has no exits but has a vortex that probably leads out
somewhere. When you die, your corpse is moved to White Raven's room.
