*Long ago during a great war, a [dragon](Dragons "wikilink") crashed to
the earth. It crashed so hard that it had buried itself within the
earth. Legends have it that this [dragon](Dragons "wikilink")
crash-landed near the [now ruined drow city of
Reveria](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria "wikilink"). Recent reports of
earthquakes and hot steam rising up from cracks within the earth have
brought up the story of this legend once again. Some believe [the dragon
that entombed itself eons ago](Forgotten_Dragon,_Zikthro "wikilink")
still lives and breathes beneath [the
city](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria "wikilink"), while others say it's
just a shift in the tectonic plates and it is nothing to worry about.
Whichever it is, it deserves to be investigated further.*

## Adevnturing

A great solo or duo spot for 30-35s. The experience gains tend to be
decent because the area is rarely frequented. Disenchanted trolls flee;
the other trolls wield and aggie. Bats are not aggie. Can expect
300-450xp a kill in the low 30s.
