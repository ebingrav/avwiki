*Every so often the balance of the Planescape shifts, and a formerly
hidden world is revealed. One such recently discovered realm is home to
a neglected asylum. Here many souls live out their pitiful existence
suffering in squalor. Who would create such a terrible world, and what
do they have to gain from it?*
