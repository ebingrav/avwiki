*Back in the time before the [Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") existed, the
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink") posed a significant threat to
the defenseless lands of [Midgaard
Country](:Category:_Midgaard_Country "wikilink"), the
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") between the
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink") and the city of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"). An outpost was constructed
on the eastern banks of the
[river](:Category:_Rivers_Of_Avatar "wikilink") that flows down the
center of the landscape to keep a watchful eye on anything that may
emerge from the [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink") and threaten
the people. However, eventually the [Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") was built and the
outpost was no longer needed, and only kept minimally complemented. That
is, until a band of savage [orcs](Orcs "wikilink") had taken up
residence in the abandoned vineyards to the east and began raiding the
farms across the [river](:Category:_Rivers_Of_Avatar "wikilink"). Now,
the outpost is painfully understaffed and overwhelmed by the constant
brutality of the [orcish](Orcs "wikilink") raiders.*

## Navigation

## Adventuring

There is a small number of mobs in the area, with the level 19 [Frontier
Guards](Frontier_Guard "wikilink") and [Orc
Raiders](Orc_Raider "wikilink") facing off. The raiders are
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), but also
[sentinel](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink"), so they won't chase you. The mobs
are a bit tougher than usual since they wear gear.
