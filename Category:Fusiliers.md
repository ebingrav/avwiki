*The first Fusiliers were [gnomish](Gnomes "wikilink"),
[dwarvish](Dwarves "wikilink") and [halfling](Halflings "wikilink")
heroes during the Great Wars when the Giants of Straul devastated the
world. Armed with little more than
[slings](:Category:_Slings "wikilink"), throwing axes and boomerangs,
they fought enemies five times their size and prevailed. This tradition
continues in the Fusilier [Prestige
Class](:Category:_Prestige_Classes "wikilink"). They are adept at
abusing their small size to confound larger opponents, are highly
skilled with [slings](:Category:_Slings "wikilink") and [throwing
weapons](:Category:_Throwing_Weapons "wikilink").*

*Like all [Prestige Classes](:Category:_Prestige_Classes "wikilink"),
they retain the original class's [Prime
Requisite](Prime_Requisite "wikilink"), in this case,
[Dexterity](Dexterity "wikilink"). Fusiliers cannot become
[Assassins](:Category:_Assassins "wikilink"), like
[Archers](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") can.*

*Given that Fusiliers hunt [giants](Giants "wikilink"), the few who
remain might be found in the vicinity of their prey.*

## Fusiliers in General

Fusiliers are similar to [archers](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") in
their abilities, but gameplay is somewhat different. Unlike archers who
work best while being tanked, fusiliers are at their best while either
tanking or solo adventuring. This is not to say that in groups they
don't contribute, quite the contrary - read on for more details.

Fusiliers excel at dodging enemies larger than themselves and get
bonuses when targeting the same with their slings. This is why only
small races can become fusiliers, and sprites are notable for two
reasons - they are the smallest race available (virtually all mobs will
be larger than it), as well as the fusilier's dodge bonuses stack well
with sprite's racial dodge.

Furthermore, the general concept behind fusilier gameplay is to use
scattershot extensively - when launching many stones the damage they do
is similar to mages at high surge - ie. very high damage output.

For new players, having a hero level Fusilier can be extremely helpful
as they can often easily collect gear solo and thus can be used to gear
up your future characters.

## Fusilier Creation

Requirements:

-   level 50 Archer
-   Fairly healthy
-   Small
-   Slay an untamed giant

The giant you need to slay is the strong-willed giant in Trials of Zin.
Directions from [Zin](Zin "wikilink"): e, s, 2u, w, s.

When it says "fairly healthy" it should say "very healthy", particularly
given that you have to be a small race. A full set of hp gear will
easily give you 500 hp though, so this shouldn't be an issue. Based on
some testing, 697 hp was not sufficient, but 705 was, so 700 seems to be
the cutoff point.

Races that can gain the fusilier prestige are all either small or very
small. Note that is it possible to remort a fus into a medium or larger
race - but this only limits them since they will lose the bonuses
against the mobs they "overgrew".

Good creatable races include: Dwarf/Duergar (high HP, can later become
Ignatur), Gnome/Deep Gnome and Halfling.

Popular remort races include:

-   [Ignatur](Ignatur "wikilink") for their hardiness (high HP and best
    [racial armor](:Racial_Armorancient "wikilink"))
-   [Sprite](Sprite "wikilink") for their extra dodge and bonuses
    against small sized enemies.
-   [Demonseed](Demonseed "wikilink") for their very high dexterity and
    good archery.

## Fusiliers at Hero Tier

At hero tier fusiliers are very versatile. They can farm gear with ease,
explore areas using their archer skills like [Map
Lore](Map_Lore "wikilink") and [Track](Track "wikilink"), are not
limited in anti-magic rooms, and can [Skin](Skin "wikilink") the mobs
for special items, same as archers.

The combined damage output from scattershot is very high - approximately
similar to surge 4 disintegrate if all stones hit the target, but they
can scatter 2 extra stones if being tanked for even more damage. To keep
track of all stone hits have CONFIG +BATTLESELF configured.

Another aspect of Fusilier gameplay is their proficiency with [ thrown
weapons](:Category:Throwing_Weapons "wikilink"). When scattershoting is
impractical (hero groups moving quickly, one-rounding mobs, or lack of
ammo) thrown weapons can give a moderate boost to damage, but they will
require foddering and often pick-up triggers, lest they be left behind.

### Training

Train attributes in the usual order for non-casters: wisdom,
constitution, and then intelligence. You can leave strength (which will
give a HR bonus) and dexterity (AC bonus) for later.

### Practicing

Practice all the important skills first: transportation spells,
sanctuary/frenzy, pass door, fly, water breathing, cure spells, sneak,
move hidden, dodge.

Of special note are:

-   [Precise Shot](Precise_Shot "wikilink") - this enables fusiliers to
    use slings,
-   [Underfoot](Underfoot "wikilink") - increases damage significantly
    and gives "second dodge" (or "third" if sprite),
-   [Barkskin](Barkskin "wikilink") - useful when barkskin isn't
    otherwise available,
-   [Fusillade](Fusillade "wikilink") - only available at hero 500, it
    allows 2 more stones to be fired - effectively increasing damage by
    60% if soloing.

The [Quick Draw](Quick_Draw "wikilink") and [Trick
Throw](Trick_Throw "wikilink") skills are used with thrown weapons, but
these are best used when grouped, something many fusiliers do not have
the need for - so it depends on your personal gameplay style.

### Devoting

Worship and devotion choices are identical to archers.

See: [Archer Worship](:Category:Archers#Worshipping "wikilink") and
[Archer Devoting](:Category:Archers#Devoting "wikilink") for more
information.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Soloing is where fusiliers find themselves easily. After
Hero 101 when [Underfoot](Underfoot "wikilink") and
[Scattershot](Scattershot "wikilink") become available, they can solo as
well as spellcasters. At first use mixed gear (see [Tanking In Hit
Gear](Tanking_In_Hit_Gear "wikilink") for information on gear
selection), and later use regular HR gear - fusiliers won't be left
wanting for HP. When soloing, scattershot is used almost exclusively.
Soloing becomes super charges once a fusilier reaches Hero 500 and gains
\[\[Fusillade\].

**Tanking:** If one can solo, one can also tank. With a healer in tow,
using mixed or straight HR gear (depending on size), nothing prevents
fusiliers to tank and deal solid damage while at it. Their rescue will
be out-of-class and slow, but that is true for most classes.

**Hitting:** After [Fusillade](Fusillade "wikilink"), fusiliers can
scatter 7 stones when being tanked, and depending on area selection can
deal significant damage. If using single stones only, their damage will
be somewhat less than that of an archer, but consistent.

**Healing:** Similar to archers, fusiliers are usually too busy to heal.
Equipping brandishes or wands will leave them unable to shoot, but they
can cast [Heal](Heal "wikilink") and other curatives when idle.

### Fusiliers and the Ultimate Dragon

One more thing to keep in mind is that unlike archers, fusiliers cannot
skin the Ultimate Dragon for [Ultimate Archer's
Gauntlet](Ultimate_Archer's_Gauntlet "wikilink").

If you are intent on getting this important piece of archer gear, only
two options are available:

-   use a regular archer to defeat UD and skin the gauntlet, then remort
    onto a sprite/dsd and become a fusilier,
-   defeat UD as a creatable archer and then descend and become a
    fusilier - solution for remaining dwarf, halfling, etc.

The Ultimate Dragon is a very easy fight for fusiliers and can be taken
down in \~8 rounds scattershotting regular splinter stones. Be sure you
can self-spell and adding some save vs spells (e.g. 2x [Namure's Leather
Collar](Namure's_Leather_Collar "wikilink")) can help.

## Fusiliers at Lord Tier

See [Archers at lord
tier](:Category:Archers#Archers_at_Lord_Tier "wikilink").

Fusiliers can do even better damage than archers using
[scattershot](scattershot "wikilink") to fire 9 stones per round. The
damage is comparable to a spellcaster if you use scattershot
consistently through the run. Moreover, if the mob is bashed, the damage
increases by 50%. Therefore, with a basher/pusher/feller in the group,
fusiliers are capable of doing a tremendous amount of damage. However
keep in mind that scattershot uses up ammunition very fast, so you need
to have fletched a **large** amount of them in advance.

Note that simply typing 'scat' will send 5 stones, even with a sling
when it should send either 7 in direct combat or 9 otherwise. To get 7
or 9 you have to specify, i.e, 'scat 9'.

Ice stones (un-armored opponents) can be bought on Thorngate from the
Old Hunter, but lightning stones (armored opponents) need to be
fletched.

## Fusilier Remort Options

[Sprites](Sprites "wikilink") and [demonseeds](demonseeds "wikilink")
are good options for remort. Fusiliers cannot remort to
[assassins](:Category:_Assassins "wikilink"), like archers can.
