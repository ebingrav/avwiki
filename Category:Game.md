*Some say that we are all merely pawns in a grand chess game played by
the [Immortals](:Category:_Immortals "wikilink"). Some say that even the
greatest of our Realm's [Heroes](:Category:_Hero "wikilink") and [Lords
and Ladies](:Category:Lord "wikilink") are merely playing pieces of the
[Great Gods](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses "wikilink") upon the
Chessboard of Destiny. Others say this chessboard floats on a cloud over
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"), but few believe such a crazy
tale.*

## Navigation

It's a 8 by 8 grid! A chess board. Shizaga is to the west and Bhyss is
to the east.

## Adventuring

Area works just like a chess board - eight by eight squares. When
running here pretty much wander and kill. One problem with this area is
a lack of mobs (only 32), and also avoid bringing large groupies to this
area with 3000hp+ if you can since Shizaga's pawns are doppelgangers and
will copy at random.

Area is good experience for low heroes, if you can kill fast and not
become unlucky. It is also known to get swarmy. It is important to learn
which mobs are aggie and which are not when running here.

-   Aggie Mobs: Queens (note: avoid fighting these, they are high level
    and can seriously hurt the tank/groupies), knights, and Shizaga
    pawns (note: Shizaga pawns will clone groupies; this is why you
    should avoid large groupies).

<!-- -->

-   Non-Aggie Mobs: Kings, rooks (note: rooks are also large mobs but a
    decent group can take them), bishops, and Bhyss pawns.

## Affects

As of October 2011, the area features a small increase in experience
gains and a bit less loss of self on death.
