*A short while after the Closing of the Grim Gates of Hell, the Lizard
Lord known as Bask returned bloody and broken from a Shift to Tarterus.*

*While healing under the care of Rietta, he is said to have muttered,*

*"She is free! Free!"*

*"Cannot be defeated now... too powerful ...free..."*

*"She and Anthraxus... may the Gods protect us..."*

*"The Garden... the garden... the garden..."*

**Builder:** Dev

## Directions

From [Tarterus](:Category:Tarterus "wikilink") shift portal to [Garden
Gargoyle](Garden_Gargoyle "wikilink"), or walk 1u, 1s, 3e and quaff the
fountain. The rest of the garden lies south from this room, behind a
locked gate. Check the dwarf on
[Thorngate](:Category:Thorngate "wikilink") before you shift. If he has
the [Cold Iron Key](Cold_Iron_Key "wikilink") buy it from him. Otherwise
you'll need to get the key from [Anthraxus](Anthraxus "wikilink"). See
[Gear In Garden](:Category:Gear_In_Garden "wikilink") for more
information.

## Connections

-   From [Tarterus](:Category:Tarterus "wikilink"): 1u, 1s, 3e, quaff.
    Quaffing at the Gargoyle Guardians takes you back into Tarterus - to
    [Anthraxus](Anthraxus "wikilink").
-   [Temple Of The Council](:Category:Temple_Of_The_Council "wikilink"):
    Kill all servants within a repop for the portal to appear. Temple of
    the Council is the [Demon](Demon "wikilink") quest area.
-   2n2d2ed from shift to demogorg

## Navigation

The boneyard/hedge/grave maze, where you can find a lot of [Digger
Demons](Digger_Demon "wikilink") and the [Black
Armband](Black_Armband "wikilink"), straight south and then first west
from the gate. Directions to the Gravemaster: 4s, 3w, s, e, s.
Alternatively, avoid the mazes and approach him from the other side: 8s,
2w, n, e, n.

The model of
[Midgaardia](:Category:Midgaardia "wikilink")/[Thorngate](:Category:Thorngate "wikilink")
is 8s, 3e from the gate. This part of the area is less swarmy, and is
home to the [Stone Wings](Stone_Wings "wikilink") and [Great Shield
Tyranny](Great_Shield_Tyranny "wikilink"). Straight directions to the
statues: 8s, 3e, 5s, 4w, s.

If you go 2n from the statues you will hit *The Ashes of Knowledge*,
sometimes relevant in the Fire Giant evolution quest.

See the map for the detailed overlay.

## Adventuring

A great area for groups size 5 to 15. Home of the [Stone
Wings](Stone_Wings "wikilink"), [Great Shield
Tyranny](Great_Shield_Tyranny "wikilink"), and [Black
Armband](Black_Armband "wikilink"). See [Gear In
Garden](:Category:Gear_In_Garden "wikilink") for more information. The
[Digger Demons](Digger_Demon "wikilink") that roam parts of the garden
are also very nice exp.
