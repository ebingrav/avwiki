Suggested Group Size: 8-12

Note that you need a rogue with lockpicks in the group. If you don't
have one you can start at the [Fae Gate
Guard](Fae_Gate_Guard "wikilink") (portable mob in
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia "wikilink")) and try collecting keys, but
this will make the run take **much** longer.

Shift to [Astral](:Category:Astral "wikilink") and go 2d to reach the
Golems room (Rainbow Bridge). There are 9 golems here. They don't hit
particularly hard, but their damage can add up. If you have a sor/wzd
that's feeling brave, this is a great room to [Flash](Flash "wikilink").
After you kill the Golems go down, but realize that this will cause you
to leave [Astral](:Category:Astral "wikilink") and enter
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia "wikilink"). So be careful not to leave any
weapons/groupies/corpses behind in the golem room. Note: Quaffing from
the room just below the golems will take you back.

Once you've entered [Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia "wikilink") via the
Rainbow Bridge, go w,s. Here the rogue will need to pick up. From there
the Citadel is a mostly linear path to the top, where the [High King
Adrial](High_King_Adrial "wikilink") and the [Ruling
Glyph](Ruling_Glyph "wikilink") are. Along this path, whenever you scan
and see a clump of [Glass Dragons](Glass_Dragon "wikilink") or [Glass
Elementals](Glass_Elemental "wikilink"), tell the rogue in the group to
pick up.

Despite the linearity of this area, there are still a few important
decisions you need to make along the way:

At the fork on the 2nd circle south will take you to
[Finn](Finn "wikilink"), who holds the [Mantle Of
Honor](Mantle_Of_Honor "wikilink") and [Finn's
Crossbow](Finn's_Crossbow "wikilink").

At the fork on the 3rd circle west will take you to the advisors. The
[Southern Advisor](Southern_Advisor "wikilink") has the [Invasion
Plans](Invasion_Plans "wikilink") (ticket for
[istone](Inferno_Stone "wikilink") run). On scan he shows up as having a
square jaw and two longswords. The [Northern
Advisor](Northern_Advisor "wikilink") has the [Book Of Force
Field](Book_Of_Force_Field "wikilink") (wzd spellbook).

At the fork on the 4th circle north will take you to the harem. From
there [Manon Of The Spring](Manon_Of_The_Spring "wikilink") is 2e. She
loads with the [Cape Of Angel
Feathers](Cape_Of_Angel_Feathers "wikilink") and the [Ruby
Dagger](Ruby_Dagger "wikilink"). Note that [Citadel
Arcadia](:Category:Citadel_Arcadia "wikilink") is an area with mostly
good-aligned mobs, so unless you have a priest to cast
[Absolve](Absolve "wikilink"), you should kill
[Manon](Manon_Of_The_Spring "wikilink"), or at least a few of her
swains, to keep your gear from zapping off.

You'll know you've reached the boss when you scan and you see 7
bodyguards all in a room above you. That's where the [High King
Adrial](High_King_Adrial "wikilink") is, but he's lvl 200 and invis, so
you won't see him on scan. In this room 1d of
[Adrial](High_King_Adrial "wikilink") you'll also see some [Glass
Dragons](Glass_Dragon "wikilink") on scan. These are the only mobs in
the area that load with the second tier hit piece [Cloud Of Dancing
Shards](Cloud_Of_Dancing_Shards "wikilink").
[Adrial](High_King_Adrial "wikilink") is a high level mob, and he wields
and offhands [Diamond Daggers](Diamond_Dagger "wikilink"), so he hits
pretty hard. Note that his bodyguards are all pretty weak. You can't
camp the glyph because [Adrial](High_King_Adrial "wikilink") doesn't
repop normally with the rest of the room. Once you get the glyph you can
go down to reach a [Homeshiftable](Homeshift "wikilink") room.
