From shift, go 4n and send tank north to areaspell. Note that the [Roc
Wyrm Mother](Roc_Wyrm_Mother "wikilink")'s corpse skins into the
[Shaleskin Arm Guard](Shaleskin_Arm_Guard "wikilink").

After killing wyrms, go down into [Mountain Of
Madness](:Category:Mountain_Of_Madness "wikilink") and track
[Quartermaster](Quartermaster "wikilink"), who carries a widow's tear
and the [Summons From Alastar](Summons_From_Alastar "wikilink") (key for
dstone). Along the path wanders [Krakor The
Overseer](Krakor_The_Overseer "wikilink"), who loads with the [Mark Of
Madness](Mark_Of_Madness "wikilink"), and the [Dwarven
Forgehand](Dwarven_Forgehand "wikilink"), who load with the [Dwarven
Sling](Dwarven_Sling "wikilink").

Once you have the [Summons From
Alastar](Summons_From_Alastar "wikilink") track [Rantus The
Doorman](Rantus_The_Doorman "wikilink"), kill him, and unlock/go up; you
can regen/respell here. From here you'll be heading straight up to get
to the gear room, which is 4u. In the second to last room (3u) is the
[Earth Golem](Earth_Golem_(lord) "wikilink"), who wields and hits
extremely hard, so be nice and regenned before you enter...the last
thing you want is for the golem to repop on you.

[Alastar](Mad_Dwarf_Alastar "wikilink"), [Bellius](Bellius "wikilink")
(who loads the [Ancient Dragon Claw](Ancient_Dragon_Claw "wikilink")),
and a few other mobs are all gathered in the next room up. This room is
extremely painful on hps, so you need a long chain and casters to surge
3-4, even after Alastar dies. You can then plane from that room or go
1d, kill spy, and home. If you want to camp, you have to stay in
[Alastar](Mad_Dwarf_Alastar "wikilink")'s room, since the down is a
one-way exit back to the beginning of the [Mountain Of
Madness](:Category:Mountain_Of_Madness "wikilink")
