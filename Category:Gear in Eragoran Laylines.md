STEPS:

\(1\) Enter the area. From Nowhere you'll see a room with four mobs,
including some "sentient energy".

Entrance is a large room (small mobs are level 171, big one is 211).

\(2\) Walk among the four subareas, using "enter synapse" to move among
them. Area is full of drifting level 171+ mobs who can swarm 3-7 per
room.

\(3\) In each subarea, go up,up to find a "Power Node" room; these areas
are large rooms (mobs are level 171,171,171,211). Kill the sentient
energy creature in each room for a [Soulfire](Soulfire "wikilink").

All Soulfires are lights.

The red Soulfire is -10/10 hr/dr and its sentient creature does not
repop.

The white Soulfire is -90ac -180svs plus detect invis/hidden.

The cyan Soulfire is +25hp/+150-mana plus detect invis/hidden.

The pink Soulfire (at entrance) is +3 int/wis plus detect
invis/hidden/passdoor.

After killing all the companion mobs in the red Soulfire's room, you'll
see a rift open.

The drifting mobs do not enter these "Power Node" rooms and they are
among your least bad regen options.

\(4\) Enter the rift and begin traveling through a corridor. North,north
is a gear room -- kill Keresh (level 250) and his companions for the
[Mask Of Molten Rock](Mask_Of_Molten_Rock "wikilink") and [Carapace of
Molten Rock](Carapace_of_Molten_Rock "wikilink").

\(5\) A new rift will appear to a safe lloydable room.

\(6\) If you like, within that safe lloydable room is a hidden portal
("enter portal") that goes back to the entrance.
