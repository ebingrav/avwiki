Run referred to as Duke Z

Suggested group size: 10 - 14 (melee, much of the run is nospell, a lock
picker makes this easier)

Dirs: Shift Arcadia 3w 2s w s 2w all down, south, track misfit

Before shifting, be sure to stock up on
[crosses](White_Marble_Cross "wikilink") from
[Rietta](Rietta "wikilink"); if you plan to camp, the group should have
at least 5-6. Critical to surviving the tower is coming with [unholy
symbols](Unholy_Symbol_(Rietta's_Wonders) "wikilink") to cure the
[heartbane](Heartbane "wikilink") that the guards have on their weapons.
A [traveller's holy symbol](Travellers_Holy_Symbol "wikilink") may come
in handy as well to cure curses from the
[duke](Duke_Zarradyn "wikilink"). [Purple
Potions](Purple_Potion "wikilink") will come in handy as well.

After clearing [Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia "wikilink") shift, go west
until you reach the river. Follow it southwards until you find an exit
going down. Go down into the underground tower. The first three rooms
each contain three invisible water elementals, so its a good idea to
send a tank. At bottom of waterfall, there is an iron grating that can
be picked by a rogue or opened with key found on guard in a private room
a bit north.

Proceed down from the grating until you reach an underground pool; this
is the last rooms in which you can use magic before the saferoom!

From here head south, and then either track
[duke](Duke_Zarradyn "wikilink") or wander, seeking exits going up. The
doors between the first few levels can be picked, but from third floor,
you must find keys on the mobs. Note that if you do not close the doors
below you the key mobs could move floors and make the run impossible.

The room below fae knight on the fifth floor (with exits heading up and
down) is the saferoom; regen and respell. The rooms are nospell again
after. The duke is 3u from the saferoom, but each room in between
contains a mob. After the illusionist 2u from the saferoom, it's
probably a good idea to go back down to cast regen and heal up a bit.

[Duke Zarradyn](Duke_Zarradyn "wikilink") should be targeted upon
entering his room and requires a long tank chain. Obviously most of the
group will need to be in [hit gear](:Category:Lord_Hit_Gear "wikilink")
to successfully clear the room. Adjacent to the room are archer mobs
that constantly shoot at you while you fight and regen, so small
groupies are at risk. Drinking from the pool in [Duke
Zarradyn](Duke_Zarradyn "wikilink")'s room will take you back to the
[Fantasy Forest](:Category:Fantasy_Forest "wikilink"), from where you
can homeshift.
