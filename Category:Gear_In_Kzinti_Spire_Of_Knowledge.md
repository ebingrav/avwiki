## Gear

See [Gray Staff](Gray_Staff "wikilink") and [Katar Forged From
Kzintium](Katar_Forged_From_Kzintium "wikilink") for directions to their
respective runs.

Which one should you pick? Both are t1 AC wields, but the Gray Staff
gives a 5% bonus to hp/mana regen, and the katar is a 17/17 piercer.
Frankly, both of these secondary stats are of very marginal use.
However, gray staff seems to be somewhat more popular.

Tabulated List:

Gray Staff:

-   \+ Easier gear room
-   \- Path to Elder in Shunned World is longer
-   \- Need to have flame of imix from
    [sceptre](Sceptre_Of_Blazing_Fury.md "wikilink") run.

Katar:

-   \+ Path to Sergeant is shorter.
-   \- Harder (more finicky) gear room - goes nospell in 4-5 rounds
