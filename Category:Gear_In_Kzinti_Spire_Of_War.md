From [Kzinti Homeworld](:Category:Kzinti_Homeworld.md "wikilink") shift
go in a northeasterly direction to the sublevel in the [Spire Of
War](:Category:Kzinti_Spire_Of_War.md "wikilink"). If you have entered
the portal chambers, you've gone too far north. Head east once you are
before the pillars. *If in doubt, from shift go 1e, all n, all e, all n,
3s, w, u, track alch.* In the jungle be wary of invis [Kzinti
Hunters](Kzinti_Hunter "wikilink") who stab. Also, psions need to be
wary of [Sussuruses](Sussurus "wikilink") who stomp, on scan they show
up as a mass of vegetation or something like that. Once you enter the
sublevel via a north exit, there will be an up exit leading out of the
Spire of War, which means you're on the right path.

Once you're inside, head southwest, ignoring
[Raskartan](Raskartan "wikilink") who guards the choke point to the
[Spire Of Knowledge](:Category:Kzinti_Spire_Of_Knowledge.md "wikilink"),
looking for an open up exit to Level One. The up exit to Level Two is
also southwest. The up exit to Level Three (note: one way to Level
Three) is north in the center.

From here the safe-ish room is e2swn (or w2sen). (For those of you who
remember the old spire run, this used to be a fully safe room. This is
not the case anymore.)

If you don't have the [Golden Kzinti
Insignia](Golden_Kzinti_Insignia "wikilink") you'll need to head up. In
this part of the area are a bunch of kzinti warriors who all look the
same on scan. All the kzinti warriors must be killed to spawn the
[Golden Kzinti Insignia](Golden_Kzinti_Insignia "wikilink"). Once you
get the key, if needed return to the safe-ish room, regen and respell.

Go up as before, then up again, and kill the guardians. From there track
[Alchyzer](Alchyzer "wikilink"), like the other guardian halls, these
exits are random; he loads the [Robes Of
Wizardry](Robes_Of_Wizardry "wikilink") (level gear) and the [Book Of
Shard Storm](Book_Of_Shard_Storm "wikilink"). Northwest of
[Alchyzer](Alchyzer "wikilink") is the main gear room with
[Kortez](Kortez "wikilink"), [Taragual](Taragual "wikilink"), and two
other mobs who hold [Boots Of The
Conqueror](Boots_Of_The_Conqueror "wikilink"), [Kzintium Blade
Bracer](Kzintium_Blade_Bracer "wikilink"), [Necklace Of Severed Fae
Ears](Necklace_Of_Severed_Fae_Ears "wikilink"), [Amulet Of Cat's
Eye](Amulet_Of_Cat's_Eye "wikilink") and [Aura Of
Domination](Aura_Of_Domination "wikilink"). South of the gear room is
the best place to camp.
