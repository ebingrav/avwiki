Suggested group size: 20+, with at least 7 good tanks.

**Before you begin the run**, make sure that you have a lot of cure
poison wands or potions. On
[Midgaardia](:Category:Midgaardia "wikilink"),
[Kelsee](Kelsee "wikilink") sells rowen wood branches (wands), and the
[Alchemist](Alchemist "wikilink") sells vials of mustard extract
(potions). Both mobs are portable. Having some heal brandishes is also
very helpful.

Bring your group to [Under The
Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars "wikilink"). If the [Planar
Anchor](Planar_Anchor "wikilink") is in
[Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia "wikilink") then just shift to it.
Otherwise go to [Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia "wikilink") shift and go
s,d,w,d. See [Shiftwatch Orb](:Category:Shiftwatch_Orb "wikilink") for
suggestions on how to survive [Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia "wikilink")
shift.

From the [lloydable](lloydable "wikilink") room in [Under The
Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars "wikilink") go 3n w u 3n 4e 3n u to
reach [Obsidian Arena;
Stands](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Stands "wikilink"). Note that the 2nd
to last room in these directions has a couple of tough-ish [Gatewatch
Eyes](Gatewatch_Eye "wikilink").

Now that you're in [the
stands](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Stands "wikilink") you have some
options. You can seek out [Majestre's Crop](Majestre's_Crop "wikilink"),
[Exaltra's Mirror](Exaltra's_Mirror "wikilink"), [Onzilorne's
Bracer](Onzilorne's_Bracer "wikilink"), [Jozarill's
Belt](Jozarill's_Belt "wikilink"), [Naeadonna's
Choker](Naeadonna's_Choker "wikilink"), and/or [Havynne's
Lantern](Havynne's_Lantern "wikilink") by tracking their owners, or you
can make your way straight for "the Lady's Stair". To do that, track
[Baroness Kippiarelle](Baroness_Kippiarelle "wikilink"). If you don't
have track, head north and west. Once you see two "malevolent red eye
stirs..." above you, you've found the stair. Regen/respell (if
necessary) and prepare for the fun part.

The lady's stair is a series of three rooms. Each room has two [Obsidian
Watchmen](Obsidian_Watchman "wikilink") to kill. Surrounding each step
are mobs that longshot your group with [Doom
Toxin](Doom_Toxin "wikilink") arrows. Don't try to fight the snipers, as
they keep company with [Deathwishes](Deathwish "wikilink"). The first
two rooms of the staircase are nospell, so you'll need a relatively long
tank chain, keeping the brutes in hit gear until its almost their turn
to tank. Casters should zap groupies to cure doom toxin, or swing a heal
brandie to keep everyone alive. After you clear a room unlock or
bashdoor up to reach the next one. Remember that you can use magic once
you reach the third step. Archers should be aware that the mobs on the
stair don't seem to be affected by bow damage (either ice or lightning
arrows. The same applies to Zydarielle. The watchmen in the first room
uses charge shield, which seems to eat the hitpoints of the persons near
top of grouplist. If they get lowish it can be a good idea to remove
their wields so that they won't die from the shield damage before the
fight is over.

Lately a common tactic in groups for the stair problem is to wait for
repop before entering so the nospell rooms wont repop. Some leaders also
opt to leave the casters behind for the nospell and come get them
afterwards, just make sure they can handle a walkin or two if you do,
and the fighting group can take care of doom toxin self.

A particularly creative alternative option to the nospell staircase
rooms involves using blackjacks; a deft rog/bld/shf/bci with a high
quality blackjack could put the watchmen to sleep for a few rounds and
have the group quickly walk past them.

[Baronness Kippiarelle](Baronness_Kippiarelle "wikilink")'s room is
directly above the third step of the stair. Her room only has three
mobs, so it's not that difficult, especially when compared to the
staircase. This is where you get the [Gauntlet Of
Icicles](Gauntlet_Of_Icicles "wikilink"),
[Snowstar](Snowstar "wikilink"), [Throwing
Sickle](Throwing_Sickle "wikilink"),
[Troublemaker](Troublemaker "wikilink"), and [Rediscovering Ether, Book
3 In A 3 Part
Series](Rediscovering_Ether,_Book_3_In_A_3_Part_Series "wikilink"). This
room repops normally, so you can camp if it you'd like.

After you clear the [baronness'](Baronness_Kippiarelle "wikilink") room
you can quaff to reach [Zydarielle, Queen Of
Stars](Zydarielle,_Queen_Of_Stars "wikilink")'s room **(only if you see
the ring (lasts \~2 ticks), otherwise it will take you back to shift
inwhich case wait for repop)**. Don't enter the portal; this will take
you to the [Shiftwatch Orb](:Category:Shiftwatch_Orb "wikilink"). Note
that once you quaff you will be stuck in a no-regen section for the rest
of the run. [Zydarielle's](Zydarielle,_Queen_Of_Stars "wikilink") room
is tougher than the baronness'. The queen can immolate, instantly
killing one of your groupies. She also flashes and switches targets with
[her bow](Long_Bow,_"Deep_Shadow"_(Noctopia) "wikilink"). Additionally,
she's seemingly able to dodge arrows. The queen has the following loot:
[Black Widow Bodice](Black_Widow_Bodice "wikilink"), [Long Bow, "Deep
Shadow" (Noctopia)](Long_Bow,_"Deep_Shadow"_(Noctopia) "wikilink"),
[Starshard](Starshard "wikilink"), [Half Of The Sundered Ring
(Queen)](Half_Of_The_Sundered_Ring_(Queen) "wikilink"). Also wandering
about the area are [Starguards](Starguard "wikilink"), which each carry
a [Nightsky Cuirass](Nightsky_Cuirass "wikilink").
