# Accessing the gulch

To enter the [Forbidden
Wasteland](:Category:Forbidden_Wasteland.md "wikilink") planeshift to
[Karnath](:Category:Karnath.md "wikilink") and go n, 4w. The first room
of the Wasteland has 3 [shrouded
warders](Shrouded_Warder.md "wikilink"). Along the path you can loot the
[Curved Girtablilu Bow](Curved_Girtablilu_Bow "wikilink").

Go w,n,w,n,w,s,w to reach the **wall of gristle and bone**. Get the
[skeletal hand](Skeletal_Hand.md "wikilink") from the wall.

Go s,e,s,e,n. To your east is a 2x2 temple that contains a stabber and a
blackjacker.

Go e,s,e to reach the altar. Pull switch to reveal a down exit to [Zedek
the desecrator](Zedek_The_Desecrator.md "wikilink").

Give Zedek the hand and he'll blow up the wall for you, clearing the way
to [Patriarchs' Gulch](:Category:Patriarchs'_Gulch.md "wikilink"). He
also creates a portal for you, so you don't have to walk back to the
wall. One room down from the room he portals to is
[Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink"), so summon the anchor here to farm
multiple Gulch runs.

Zedek also accepts the [last remaining drop of
goo](Last_Remaining_Drop_Of_Goo.md "wikilink"). This item can be
obtained by killing all the "goo" related mobs in the [Forbidden
Wasteland](:Category:Forbidden_Wasteland.md "wikilink") (they don't
repop). The drop is tougher to get than the hand, but it's a good option
if you want to move the [Planar Anchor](Planar_Anchor "wikilink") out of
[Karnath](:Category:Karnath.md "wikilink") and still be able to easily
return to the gulch later on.

Opening Gulch will take about 24-48 tics, depending on your group.

# Discovering the royal tomb

Suggested group size: \~20, with at least 1 bzk and 1 prs. Having 2+ bzk
and 2 prs is highly recommended. A good balance between melee and caster
is also necessary to clear the symbol portion of this run. The run is
doable with less, but will probably take significantly longer.

**Read the entire section below before attempting it to get an idea of
what you will need to do; if you have to reference this after each
ticket, I can guarantee your run will take much longer.**

### Tickets neeed to access the tomb

-   [Olive Branch](Olive_Branch "wikilink")
-   [Dusty Work Gloves](Dusty_Work_Gloves "wikilink")
-   [Well-Oiled Leather Sheath](Well-Oiled_Leather_Sheath "wikilink")
-   [Evenly Balanced Scale](Evenly_Balanced_Scale "wikilink")

#### Golden Scarab Medallion

From the [Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink") room go d,w,s and kill the
[restless spirit](Restless_Spirit.md "wikilink") to get the [golden
scarab medallion](Golden_Scarab_Medallion.md "wikilink"). This is a key
that unlocks the **unfinished tomb**.

#### Olive Branch

Go u,w and kill the [captain of the honor
guard](Captain_Of_The_Honor_Guard.md "wikilink"). He spawns an [olive
branch](Olive_Branch.md "wikilink") on death. This is one of four
tickets you need to get the [key to the royal burial
chamber](Key_To_The_Royal_Burial_Chamber.md "wikilink").

  
\- Note that this room is one of the most painful rooms on the run. The
mobs can toss/bash and hit very very hard. I suggest letting your bzk
get their hp knocked down quite a bit in this room to prepare for the
symbols.

#### Dusty Work Gloves

Go n,e,{e} to enter the **unfinished tomb**. Get the [broken
pickaxe](Broken_Pickaxe.md "wikilink") from the pile of stoneworking
tools. Next go e,s. Give the [broken
pickaxe](Broken_Pickaxe.md "wikilink") to the [undead
contractor](Undead_Contractor.md "wikilink") before he dies. He will
repair it into the [well-maintained
pickaxe](Well-Maintained_Pickaxe.md "wikilink"), which is the key you
need to open the **ransacked tomb**. On death the contractor will spawn
the [dusty work gloves](Dusty_Work_Gloves.md "wikilink"), ticket \#2 of
4.

  
\- The dusty work gloves spawn on the ground, but the well-maintained
pickaxe will be on the contractor's corpse and looted (or not looted) by
the person who lands the killing blow.

#### Well-Oiled Leather Sheath

From the contractor's room Go n,w,w,u. This room has two portals in it:
the **symbol of Shizaga** and the **symbol of Werredan**. (It is dwuu
from the Lloydable room.) Only casters can enter Shizaga's portal, and
only melee-types can enter Werredan's portal. At the end of the caster's
leg there's a lever which opens up the final room of the brute's path.
Here you will find the [master
blacksmith](Master_Blacksmith.md "wikilink"). He can also repair your
pickaxe if you forgot to get the contractor to do it. Kill him and get
the [handle of a broken knife](Handle_Of_A_Broken_Knife.md "wikilink").

  
\- When I do this part of the run, I ideally want the bzk to be within
2-3 scars of FF upon entering the symbol. This will give you a huge
source of melee damage, and allow you to clear the melee only section
much more quickly.

\- Each section consists of 3 rooms; access to the next room is through
the portal that spawns after the last mob dies. The last room in the
melee section has a mob that can call for additional mobs to join the
fray, which means you will want to kill him quickly. This can be done by
having your bzk in Final Fury.

\- As an added incentive to bring 2+ bzk with FF, the blacksmith appears
to be spec'd like a Tortuga in Tortuga Cay. He is immune to melee, with
the exception of blunt weapons. This is why having 2 bzks is nice, as
the mob has a fairly large amount of hp, and without a high source of
damage from blunt (FF), the room will take a while.

\- I have never personally led the caster section, but I would suggest
sending in your largest caster (probably a mage or mindbender) through
the portal first to soak up the damage. I like having two priests for
this section just in case a repop gets your group messed up, since
caster rescue is laggy.

\- Caster section all lvl 130 mobs worth 60-80 xp, Room 1 (a stupid
giant), Room 2 (a robed priest x 2), Room 3 (enchanted drake, tail
stun), Room 4 (a cocky magus x 3).

From the symbol room go s, enter beam, n. [Inpuvultu, lord of the
dead](Inpuvultu,_Lord_Of_The_Dead.md "wikilink") will tell you that he's
looking for *objects which bear the stain of evil*. The knife handle is
one such object. Give it to him and he'll awaken the [Prince of
Knives](Prince_Of_Knives.md "wikilink") within the **ransacked tomb**.
To get there from Inpuvultu: enter patch,w,{s} (pickaxe key),s. The
prince wanders this small 3 room crypt. Killing him will yield the
[well-oiled leathed sheath](Well-Oiled_Leather_Sheath.md "wikilink"),
ticket \#3. While in the ransacked tomb, get the [stray chess
piece](Stray_Chess_Piece.md "wikilink") from the [corpse of a Karnathian
temple guard](Corpse_Of_A_Karnathian_Temple_Guard.md "wikilink") in the
room furthest south.

  
\- Crypt is 5 rooms long, not 3.

\- The prince carries two knives which are weight 3, 20/25 piercing
weapons ([Long, Glinting Knife](Long,_Glinting_Knife "wikilink")).
Giving Inpuvultu the knife handle will also spawn another mob that has
the [Cool Onyx Bracelet](Cool_Onyx_Bracelet "wikilink"), which is t1
wrist mana. There is also another mob in this section that may or may
not be spawned by turning in the knife handle; it is a foraging
graverobber that carries the Looter's Sack, a 2 lb container that can
carry 750 lbs.

\- The fire before the corpse contains a Bright Silver Bracer, which is
type treasure and can be sold for about 350k.

#### Evenly Balanced Scale

Bring the [stray chess piece](Stray_Chess_Piece.md "wikilink") to
Inpuvultu. To get back to Inpuvultu, ne from tunnel to get back to
condor nest/beam, enter beam & go north. He will summon the [disgraced
patriarch](Disgraced_Patriarch.md "wikilink"). The Disgraced Patriach is
north from the room with the nest/beam. Upon his death you will receive
the [evenly balanced scale](Evenly_Balanced_Scale.md "wikilink"), the
final ticket. The disgraced patriarch also carries the [Clenched
Fist](Clenched_Fist "wikilink"), a 7/7 gauntlet (t1 hit).

Turn in all four tickets to Inpuvultu. He will open an ominous
passageway. Through this portal you will find a full-safe infirmary room
that contains the [key to the royal burial
chamber](Key_To_The_Royal_Burial_Chamber.md "wikilink"). When you're
ready, go down. The door to the royal tomb will be to your north.

### Tips

A short synopsis on a few goals you want to do to make your gulch run
not take over 2 spellups:

1.  Keep the amount of times you need to regen low. Ideally, you will
    regen only twice, once after you clear the symbols, and once in the
    room with the key to the royal chamber. The Lloydable room is also
    shrine-able, so regenning there after clearing the symbols is the
    best option.
2.  Let your bzk reach Final Fury (FF) hp right before you enter the
    symbol portion so that the melee section is cleared more quickly. To
    do this, try not to let your priests heal your bzk too much during
    the run.
3.  When you turn in the broken knife and the stray chess piece, ask
    your group to remain in the room with the beam of sunlight. Only the
    leader needs to give the ticket to Inpuvultu, and his rooms are
    noregen anyways. Only after you collect the scale ticket from the
    disgraced patriach should you ask your entire group to enter the
    beam of sunlight.
4.  At the end of this section, you should have the [Clenched
    Fist](Clenched_Fist "wikilink"), [Cool Onyx
    Bracelet](Cool_Onyx_Bracelet "wikilink"), Bright Silver Bracer,
    [20/25 knives](Long,_Glinting_Knife.md "wikilink"), and maybe the
    [scythe that is a t1
    basher](Heavily_Tarnished_Scythe.md "wikilink"). The scythe comes
    from a reaper that is part of the main run.

# Facing the Patriarchs

## Requirements for gear part

The keys you need are: the golden scarab medallion and the key to the
burial chamber. The suggested group size is 20, with two healers. Even
with a fair amount of fp, it will be a struggle to clear the area and
regen before each repop. You can inno/calm from the patriarchs if
needed, they're sentinel.

## Loot

-   [Robe Of Magnificence](Robe_Of_Magnificence "wikilink") (8/8, t1 hit
    about body), on [Spirit Of
    Fattah-Ra](Spirit_Of_Fattah-Ra "wikilink")
-   [Jeweled Crown Of The
    Patriarchy](Jeweled_Crown_Of_The_Patriarchy "wikilink") (t2 ac head,
    -95 ac, +150 hp, -50 saves), pops on ground after mobs die
-   [Open Palm](Open_Palm "wikilink") (-30 ac, t1 ac on hands, zgaunts
    without hr/dr)
-   [The Subjugator](Subjugator.md "wikilink") (30/30, 80-95-110 whip,
    cannot be runed)

Other loot includes [Reptilian Battle
Armor](Reptilian_Battle_Armor "wikilink") (-75 ac, t5 ac about body),
[Lacquered Bow, "Ambush"](Lacquered_Bow,_"Ambush" "wikilink") (42 hr, t2
bow)

## Gear Area

The royal tomb is located d,w,u,{e},e,n,{n} from the
[Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink") room. If you just got the key, you're
already here. The Patriarchs themselves are behind another closed door
2n. The fight consists of 3 big mobs that each spawn a bigger mob upon
death. If you're looking to camp, **the treasury** s,e from the gear
room is probably your best bet.

-   The royal tomb has 4 rooms. In the 3 rooms before the gear room, 5
    mobs will spawn each repop. I suggest clearing these 5 mobs each
    time the gear room repops, to make sure that your sleep is
    uninterrupted for as long as possible during regen.
-   One of the 5 mobs which repop in the royal tomb is a [Trial By
    Fire](Trial_By_Fire "wikilink"). It can target cast for ERAD and
    area spell. Try to kill it first.
-   A traditional tank chain does not work so well in the gear room, as
    the mobs toss, which causes them to target your groupies seemingly
    randomly. You will need to ask your tanks to watch each other and
    just spread damage as best as possible. This is also a great reason
    to have two priests, since it is very likely your casters will take
    a round or two during the gear room, and you can't afford the extra
    time to target heal them, as the mobs do hit relatively hard (3x
    anni-erad).
-   Because of the way the gear room works, lower mana casters such as
    mages won't be able to surge 5 meteor swarm, as they will run out of
    mana as the bigger mobs spawn. I suggest letting your area casters
    surge 3 throughout the room (HiE wizards and other wizards with a
    lot of mana may be able to get away with higher surges), while
    letting your sors surge 4-5. Sors with 35k+ mana can probably afford
    surge 5 throughout.
-   If you intend to camp, try not to run your casters completely empty.
    The 5 mobs found before the gear room will probably repop before you
    can regen to full, so you want to budget your mana such that you
    don't miss a pop if possible. If you are low on mana after clearing
    the 5 mobs before the gear room, I suggest just skipping the current
    pop and regenning.
