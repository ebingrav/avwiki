**You will need the [Platinum Scale](Platinum_Scale "wikilink") from
[Memory Lane](:Category:Memory_Lane.md "wikilink").**

Recommended group size: 25+

Have everyone spellup on [Thorngate](:Category:Thorngate.md "wikilink"),
then shift to [Midgaardia](:Category:Midgaardia.md "wikilink"). You will
be in shadow form only until you enter the vortex. Portal tys san and go
2sunus5u5e2nu to reach [Ramahdon](Ramahdon "wikilink"). The dragon (and
mobs along the way) will aggie, but give [Ramahdon](Ramahdon "wikilink")
the [Platinum Scale](Platinum_Scale "wikilink") before he dies to open
the vortex. This portal only lasts a few ticks, so have the first tank,
then the rest of the group enter quickly.

There are three rooms to clear, none of which repop before reboot; once
a room is clear, you can regen/respell there as needed. Drinking will
transport you to subsequent rooms. The [Incomplete Shield Of
Lords](Incomplete_Shield_Of_Lords "wikilink") loads on [Bahamut's
Avatar](Bahamut's_Avatar "wikilink") in the last room. All other mobs
load sigils (5 Sigils total). The shield and all the sigils must be
given to [Gilliad](Gilliad "wikilink") on
[Thorngate](:Category:Thorngate.md "wikilink") to form the shield. This
is done by giving him the shield, don't give him one of the sigils
first, because then you'll have to beg an imm to get it back for you.

-   Quaffing from the first and second room will area spell the room if
    you haven't cleared the room yet. Otherwise, it will transport you
    to the next room. There is nothing to quaff in the last room.
-   Hrjaa in the first and third rooms will animate any mob corpses, so
    it might be a good idea for any sor/mnd to target it.
-   The mobs in the second room tail, and a mob in the last room can
    toss. It's a good idea to send a backup tank just after the first
    tank, and all tanks should be constantly vigilant as rescues may be
    needed outside of normal chain; chains break often and players may
    be too lagged to call for help.
-   Some of the mobs in [Sun Cabal](:Category:Sun_Cabal.md "wikilink")
    cast [Flash](Flash "wikilink"). Make sure groupies are ready to cast
    [Cure Blindness](Cure_Blindness "wikilink") on themselves and/or
    others, or carry [pink potions](Pink_Potion(lord).md "wikilink")
    from [Rietta](Rietta "wikilink").
