To get the [Elemental Earth Ring](Elemental_Earth_Ring "wikilink") shift
to the [World Of Stone](:Category:World_Of_Stone.md "wikilink") and
portal to prince. If portal fizzles, you may need to wait til he moves
out of the Earth Lord's room or track him (but avoid the [Roc Wyrm
Mother](Roc_Wyrm_Mother "wikilink")'s room 4n from shift if group is
small). Kill prince and regen, if needed. You should be able to tell
which room is the gear room on scan.

-   If the prince is not portable, it is faster to walk to him than to
    wait. From shift, the way to the area with the eering is 2e4sd.
    Remove all before going down, as that is when the det portion will
    start. Gear room is all south, then all east.
-   After clearing the gear room, the safest place to regen is 2w n.

**The Lord is no longer the only mob to detonate on this run.** (That's
why it is run more rarely today. Det mobs include Huge Earth Elemental.)
Also, some of the mobs in this area have
[Lavabombs](Lavabombs "wikilink"), which can deal considerable damage to
a single target in one hit.

The [Shaleskin Arm Guard](Shaleskin_Arm_Guard "wikilink"), while
technically in [World Of Stone
Proper](:Category:World_Of_Stone_Proper.md "wikilink"), is almost always
obtained at the beginning of a
[dstone](Living_Daemonstone.md "wikilink") run, as the [Roc Wyrm
Mother](Roc_Wyrm_Mother "wikilink") lies at the entrance to the
[Mountain Of Madness](:Category:Mountain_Of_Madness.md "wikilink").
