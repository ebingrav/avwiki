Some [objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")
[affect](Object_Affects.md "wikilink") any
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") who
[wear](Wear.md "wikilink") them with certain [skills and/or
spells](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") until they are
[removed](Remove.md "wikilink"). These
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") are categorized below.

[Wearing](Wear.md "wikilink")
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") so as to be
[affected](Affects.md "wikilink") by certain
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") can have advantages over
possible methods such as [casting](Cast.md "wikilink")
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") or
[quaffing](Quaff.md "wikilink")
[potions](:Category:_Potions.md "wikilink"), as (1) nothing needs to be
[practiced](Practice.md "wikilink") and no
[mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink") needs to be used, (2) nothing needs to
be consumed and (perhaps) replaced, and (3) such
[affects](Affects.md "wikilink") have no fixed duration and may be
easily added or removed at will simply by [wearing](Wear.md "wikilink")
or [removing](Remove.md "wikilink") whichever
[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") produces them. Doing this can
also have certain disadvantages, however, as (1) these
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") may prevent other desired
[gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") from being
[worn](Wear.md "wikilink") and (2), unlike
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink"),
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") take up some
[inventory](Inventory.md "wikilink") space and may become lost or
damaged over time.
