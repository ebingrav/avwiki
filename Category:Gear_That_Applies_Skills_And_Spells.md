Some [objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")
[affect](Object_Affects "wikilink") any
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") who
[wear](Wear "wikilink") them with certain [skills and/or
spells](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") until they are
[removed](Remove "wikilink"). These
[objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") are categorized below.

[Wearing](Wear "wikilink") [objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") so
as to be [affected](Affects "wikilink") by certain
[spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") can have advantages over possible
methods such as [casting](Cast "wikilink")
[spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") or [quaffing](Quaff "wikilink")
[potions](:Category:_Potions "wikilink"), as (1) nothing needs to be
[practiced](Practice "wikilink") and no [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink")
needs to be used, (2) nothing needs to be consumed and (perhaps)
replaced, and (3) such [affects](Affects "wikilink") have no fixed
duration and may be easily added or removed at will simply by
[wearing](Wear "wikilink") or [removing](Remove "wikilink") whichever
[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") produces them. Doing this can
also have certain disadvantages, however, as (1) these
[objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") may prevent other desired
[gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") from being [worn](Wear "wikilink")
and (2), unlike [spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink"),
[objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") take up some
[inventory](Inventory "wikilink") space and may become lost or damaged
over time.
