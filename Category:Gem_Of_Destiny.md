*All young High [Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") used the Gem of Destiny to
determine their place in the evil but very strict High
[Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") society. They challenged themselves within
the Gem against one of the toughest civilizations to have challenged the
powerful High [Drow](Drow.md "wikilink"), the snakemen of Sithiss.
Although completely wiped out by the High [Drow](Drow.md "wikilink"),
the Sithiss were still respected by the High [Drow](Drow.md "wikilink")
for their fighting prowess and thus became the constructs that the young
[drow](Drow.md "wikilink") must prove themselves against.*
