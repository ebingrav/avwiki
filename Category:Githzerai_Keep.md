*Located in the wastes of Outland, the massive, black keep is the home
of the Githzerai, sworn enemies of the Githyanki. Here they train their
warriors and plot their attacks on the Githyanki. Since the Githyanki
control most of the surface of Outland, the Keep is really the last
Githzerai line of defense, and they will defend it to the last Gish.*

**Builder:** Silence

## Directions

You'll want to portal to fem train to access the keep. Be sure to send a
tank in first, because sometimes you may end up with the Githzerai
Master of Death in a room with you.  
From shift: 3n5wu. Once you are in the keep, it is no longer homeable.

## Connections

## Navigation

## Adventuring

This area should be run with around 6 people. Be sure to have one good
ac tank, since the mobs you'll face hit fairly hard.

The most notable gear (and exp) here is the severed githyanki hand, a
12/12 held item similar to a shard of doom marble.

To access this gear, you'll need to go south until you see the King's
room 1s. Once you're here, go west, then southwestish until you reach a
stairwell.

When you reach the stairwell, open the painting north, and proceed east
through the hallway until you reach a closed south exit. Note: Each of
the rooms with the door make a great place to regen since you can wall
the only other direction.

Once you've reached the masters of death, you'll want to s3-4 them --
they hit pretty hard with weapons. In a group of 6, they're usually good
for 70-90 a pop.
