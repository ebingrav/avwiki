*A path that may cut some distance off the journey between the
[Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink") and
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") exists in the corner of the
[meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink") of [Nom](Nom "wikilink"). Some
fear it, some laugh at it... you must decide.*

**Level Range:** 4-5

**Builder:** Crom

## Directions

Walking route from [Nom](Nom "wikilink"): 4s, 5e.

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested: goblin boulder.

## Connections

This area is connected to the [Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink") and
[Highways/Great Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink").

## Navigation

This area is linear, and serves as a connecting path between the
[Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink") and [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink").

## Adventuring

This is primarily used as a connector area between the [White Stone
Road](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") and
[Nom](Nom "wikilink") in the southeast part of the
[meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink"). There are a few pieces of
[gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") in this area disguised as branches
and leaves but none of it is particularly useful. All the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in the path are
[goblins](Goblins "wikilink") even though they might not look it. Not
really anything of interest here, and not suitable for anything other
than a quick few hundred [xp](Experience_Points "wikilink") for real
small [characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink"). There are much
better places to fight in the surrounding
[areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink").
