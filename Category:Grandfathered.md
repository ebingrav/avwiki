A home for [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"),
[areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"),
[items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"), and
[skills](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") that have moved on to
the big MUD in the sky.

We won't forget you, grandfathered stuff!

*"In my day, we could energy drain creatures to get our hitpoints up to
32,000! Then we'd go and get the Ring of 36 Chambers. Mmm... ring..."*

*Due to the time AVATAR has been up and running, code and
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") changes have continually gone in new
directions, been added and removed. Gf'd
[gear](:Category:_Grandfathered_Gear "wikilink"),
[spells](:Category:_Grandfathered_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink"), and
[classes](:Category:_Grandfathered_Classes "wikilink") are things which
the staff decided should no longer be within the game. Rather than
remove them completely, however, in many cases AVATAR allowed those who
already have the [item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"),
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink"), or
[class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink"), to continue using them. The
staff simply makes the code no longer available for future players.
There are cases in which the [object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") or
code cannot be gf'd due to how abusive they are. This is a tough choice
to completely remove the use, but the coders try to be as fair as
possible in all cases.*
