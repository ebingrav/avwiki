*This graveyard is set aside for the sole use of those who die bravely
upon the [Great Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") in the
defense of [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"). The Graveyard was
built close enough to the [Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") so that those still
defending [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") could look down and
see their heroes at rest. Unfortunately, not all of the dead are at
rest.*

**Level Range:** 30-40
