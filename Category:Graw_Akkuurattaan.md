*Once this huge cavern was home to a city of drow, but after ten years
of warfare, the duergar defeated the drow and took it from them. Now,
remodelled, redesigned and rebuilt, Graw Akkuurattaan - as it is known
by the duergar, is home to the bulk of the duergar armies. A fortress
city under total control of the military, the power of [King
Domi](King_Domi "wikilink") is clearly on the rise.*

## Navigation

## Adventuring

Warning: Due to the military affairs still ongoing in Graw, visiting
this city with a Drow character (of any tier) will likely mean a quick
blackjacking and a trip to the slave pens. The slave pens are cursed so
escaping without teleport may require outside help. Otherwise, a failed
sneaking attempt may easily result in another blackjacking by the guards
and again chilling in the slave pens for a few minutes.
