''Long ago, before [humans](Humans "wikilink") reckoned time as they now
do, there was a terrible war between the [trolls](Trolls "wikilink") and
[dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink"). From the [dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink")
emerged a powerful leader, [Kra](Kra "wikilink"), gifted with the
healing touch. [Kra](Kra "wikilink") was also a ruthless military leader
who used whatever means necessary to vanquish her enemies. The
[Dwarf](Dwarves "wikilink")-[Troll](Trolls "wikilink") war lasted for
years with both sides taking heavy casualties but neither willing to
give in. In the year 478 of the Fae calendar, a terrible battle took
place at the foot of [Mt. Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink"). It is
said that the fighting was so intense that a river of blood carved deep
canyons in the desert lands. [Kra](Kra "wikilink"), along with most of
the [dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") and [trolls](Trolls "wikilink") were
killed during the battle. Both sides lacked the resources to continue
the war, which marked the end of the
[Dwarf](Dwarves "wikilink")-[Troll](Trolls "wikilink") war.

''After the battle, many of the [dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") settled
north of [Mt. Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink") and built a temple to
their fallen leader. Unfortunately, the story does not end there. The
followers of [Kra](Kra "wikilink") were divided with some worshiping her
for her healing powers while others for her military might. As time
passed, the two factions began to argue more and small battles broke
out.

''During the second war of the [Giants](Giants "wikilink") and
[Ents](Ents "wikilink") the sky thundered and the ground rocked and much
was destroyed. The devastation split the temple into two parts and cast
them east and west. Only the altar, the heart of [Kra](Kra "wikilink")'s
power, remained untouched as violent upheavals cracked the earth.

*As the earth slowly stilled and the destruction ceased, the
[dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") regrouped. The followers of
[Kra](Kra "wikilink")'s dark path took up residence in the western half
of the temple while the Light followers of [Kra](Kra "wikilink") resided
in the eastern half. Since then they have waged constant war, each
trying to destroy the other in their quest for [Kra](Kra "wikilink")'s
power.*

## Navigation

The beginning part (from Wartha) is a mazeish block of passageways all
generally leading north towards the area proper. Once clear of the
cliffs there is a 'Forsaken Trail' block, similar in navigation to the
'Desert Canyons'. To the east is the Light Temple and to the west is the
Dark Temple. Light Temple has a secret passage from its second floor
exiting near the dark temple, west of the 'Altar of Kra' (safe room).
This secret tunnel also connects to the
[Deepways](:Category:Deepways "wikilink").

## Adventuring

PP [Wartha](Wartha "wikilink") and head west. Lots of aggies, can be
swarmy at times. Decent exp.

The initial area (west from Wartha) contains some
[bandits](Gypsy_Bandit "wikilink") (can stab, carry poisoned weapons)
and [dervishes](Desert_Dervish "wikilink") (non-aggie). There are also a
couple of sentinel [living rocks](Living_Rock "wikilink").

Heading 3w, n, e, all north from Wartha will take you to the Forsaken
Trail. This leads you to the main area. The area is divided (hence the
area name) into two temples, the light (east) and the dark (west). The
mobs here are clerists, paladins, warriors (all are dwarves),
[sandmen](Elemental_Sandman "wikilink") and various beasts like the
[Insatiable One](Insatiable_One "wikilink"), the [Abysmal
One](Abysmal_One "wikilink") and so on. The clerists and sandmen are not
aggies, most of the rest are. Most of the dwarves are armored and many
wield.

There is a down exit in the room called "Deep in the earth" which leads
to [ Deepways](:Category:_Deepways "wikilink") (near the [Faceless
One](Faceless_One "wikilink")).

Watch out for the [Insatiable One](Insatiable_One "wikilink"), a corpse
eating mob in this area.

There are only three non-cursed rooms in this area: 'Opening in the
cliffs' (wartha) and 'Shattered wall' (1s of the forgemaster), and 'The
one with the Abyss', which has no exits and is only good to leave the
area.

The 'Altar of Kra' room is anti-magic but safe.
