*Long ago, during the tumultuous times of warfare, the area near the
[town of Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink") was a wild and
dangerous place. Due to the large number of adventurers in the area, a
combat school teaching the skills of weapons and hand-to-hand combat as
well as offensive spellcasting was formed. As the area became more
civilized and peaceful, fewer sought an education in the arts of combat.
The school eventually closed and ancient vallenwoods that housed the
school grew untended. Many years later a dirty battleworn goblin
appeared, bedecked in mismatched armor, riding astride a mangy goat. The
goblin proudly proclaimed himself the '[Great
Grunka](Great_Grunka "wikilink")' and announced his plans to re-open the
ancient combat school and teach the ways of [goblin](Goblins "wikilink")
combat. While many laughed at the time, the school prospers as
[goblins](Goblins "wikilink") from across the realm come to learn from
[Grunka](Great_Grunka "wikilink") himself.*

## Connections

This area is connected to [Crystalmir
Lake](:Category:_Crystalmir_Lake "wikilink").

## Navigation

This area is shaped like a square. The bottom floor is where the [Great
Grunka](Great_Grunka "wikilink") can be found, while the top floor
features four of the tougher goblin students that hold gear. The two
floors are connected by exits at the corners of the square. Many mobs
wander both floors that are good for exp. See the map for more details.

## Adventuring

Grunka's is one of the more commonly run areas for [its level
range](:Category:_Lowmort_1-10_Areas "wikilink"). It's an excellent
place to level due to both the high
[experience](Experience_Points "wikilink") per
[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") and the
[alignment](Alignment "wikilink") of most
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") being evil (a rarity for
[areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") this low). Generally, once a new
[alt](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") outgrows the [Mob
Factory](:Category:_Mob_Factory "wikilink"), this is their next stop.
The only problem with this [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") is that
everyone knows how good the [exp](Experience_Points "wikilink") is, so
it is often times crowded and overrun. An alternative to this area for
about the same level range could be [The
Weeping](:Category:_Weeping "wikilink").

The only real dangerous [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in the area
are [Grunka](Great_Grunka "wikilink") (he's sanced and his pupils have
the annoying tendency to [assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink")) who has
the [goblin boots of fleeing](Goblin_Boots_Of_Fleeing "wikilink") (+mvs)
and the goblins in the trees with the wields. The goblin mages will
[cast](Spellcasting_Mobs "wikilink"), but their spells tend to do little
damage. The serving kobolds will [steal gold](Thieving_Mobs "wikilink"),
and sometimes the goblins will [assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink").
