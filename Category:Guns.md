*Rumors speak of metal devices that launches small
[bullets](:Category:_Bullets "wikilink") with great speed and loud
rapport. Not especially accurate or reliable, skilled
[archers](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") may still be able to put these
to some use, if they do indeed exist.*

Guns have no penalty in combat (like [light
crossbows](:Category:_Light_Crossbows "wikilink")), do not suffer the
restring (or occasional failure) that crossbows do, and do more damage
than light crossbows (but less than [ heavy
crossbow](:Category:_Heavy_Crossbows "wikilink")). Guns can be used to
[longshot](Longshot "wikilink") but do not
[scattershot](Scattershot "wikilink"). Bullets cannot be
[fletched](Fletch "wikilink") and two mobs sells them and but only
steel/piercing. There are no splinter bullets. There are a few mobs that
carry faerie and exploding bullets (in very small quantities).
