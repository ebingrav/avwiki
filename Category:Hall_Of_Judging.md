This [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") comes and goes. It provides
temporary access to player-built [areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink")
submitted for [area-building
contests](Area-Building_Contests.md "wikilink"). Once all of these
contest [areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") have been judged and
their individual fates have been determined and brought about, this hall
disappears until it is needed again for another
[contest](Area-Building_Contests.md "wikilink").
