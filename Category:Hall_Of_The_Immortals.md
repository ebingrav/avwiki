*The gods have given [Snikt](Snikt "wikilink") the role of guardian for
their universe. He has in turn recruited others through time to serve as
caretakers for Migaardia and the otherworldly planes. While they serve
the realm, they are [immortal](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink").
These Immortals work hard to keep the realm running smoothly. Here,
Immortals past and present are commemorated for all time.*

**Level Range:** 1\~45 **Builder:** [Cerdwyn](Cerdwyn "wikilink") and
[Qismat](Qismat "wikilink")

## Experience

It is possible to kill the statues of most of the immortals, with a few
obvious exceptions. The level of the statues rises with immortal rank,
from Retired (level 1) through to Admin (level 45).

## Questing

There are a few easy, unrepeatable quests in this area.

<spoiler text='Spoiler: A list of the statues with quests'> The
following statues currently have quests:

-   Belanor
-   Cerdwyn
-   Zahri

These quests are fairly simple, so no instructions on the wiki, please.

## Setting alignment

As the majority of the retired immortals in the basement are of very
good alignment, and very low level, players wishing to set their
alignment to evil by killing good mobiles may find it a good place to
visit. However, use of the spell "detect alignment" is advised, in order
to avoid the few evil or neutral mobs.
