*Between the great city of [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink")
and the southern coast lies a desolate oak forest. Some say it is
haunted; others maintain that an evil necromancer inhabits [a dangerous
tower](:Category:_Necromancer's_Tower "wikilink") deep within the wood.
A few brave souls claim to have survived an encounter with a fearsome
[dragon](Dragons "wikilink") whose lair is hidden in the forest.*

## Navigation

## Adventuring

The level range for this area was tightened from 35-51 to 40-45 in March
2013, with the exception of the Hero level [Ice
Dragon](Ice_Dragon "wikilink") and
[Knight](Knight_(Haunted_Forest) "wikilink"). Casters around 39-41 might
find it useful to approach from the [Defender's
Graveyard](:Category:Defender's_Graveyard "wikilink") entrance, as this
will take you to the field with the scarecrow and crows. That little
area is non-aggie with a fair amount of level 41-42 mobs.
