*Between the great city of [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink")
and the southern coast lies a desolate oak forest. Some say it is
haunted; others maintain that an evil necromancer inhabits [a dangerous
tower](:Category:_Necromancer's_Tower.md "wikilink") deep within the
wood. A few brave souls claim to have survived an encounter with a
fearsome [dragon](Dragons.md "wikilink") whose lair is hidden in the
forest.*

## Adventuring

The level range for this area was tightened from 35-51 to 40-45 in March
2013, with the exception of the Hero level [Ice
Dragon](Ice_Dragon.md "wikilink") and
[Knight](Knight_(Haunted_Forest).md "wikilink"). Casters around 39-41
might find it useful to approach from the [Defender's
Graveyard](:Category:Defender's_Graveyard.md "wikilink") entrance, as
this will take you to the field with the scarecrow and crows. That
little area is non-aggie with a fair amount of level 41-42 mobs.
