*At the base of the Northern Hills, the River of Eragora ends in a
wooded land sacred to the half-orcs. No halfling is permitted to set
foot on the hallowed ground on pain of death. Every winter solstice
while the earth lies fallow, dark rituals are rumored to take place
within the depths of the forest while the rest of the land sleeps.*

## Directions

Walking route from [Eragora default
recall](Eragora_default_recall "wikilink"): 2s, d, 4e, enter river, 3n,
3e, 4n, 2w, 2n, 2e, 3n, 2e.

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Winkum](Winkum "wikilink") or pp *half-orc family* or *half-orc mother*
should work. Othewrwise pp just outside the area (pp [Dirk
Chivers](Dirk_Chivers "wikilink")) and walk the 10 rooms in between.

## Navigation

The area has a simple yet engaging and elegant design that promotes
exploration and a search for fluff. A few rooms are underwater, so don't
drown.

It is not possible to recall from this area outwards. Recalling within
the area is possible, as well as recalling to the area.

Note that the map is currently a bit out-of-date.

## Adventuring

The area has surprisingly small mobs (by Eragoran standards, at least),
and relatively weak hitting, so once can solo here easily or bring a
buddy if very small. An archer/fusilier helps (due to some nice skin
gear).

There are no quests in the area per se, but the mobs and gear contained
are involved in several quests originating in other Eragoran areas.

A great majority of the mobs do not see invisible or sneak/move-hidden.
Maintaining a low profile will make speedwalking easy.

To make matters even easier, the area will auto-CR the player upon
(standard) death. Since the only way into the cloud room is dying, be
sure to get all from your corpse **prior** to leaving. And since it is
anti-magic you will **not** be able to cast giant strength in the cloud
room. Prepare accordingly.
