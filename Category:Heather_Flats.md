*Heather Flats is the name of a small
[Halfling](Halflings.md "wikilink") farming village south of the Dwarven
Trade Route. It got its name because when the first settlers arrived on
the scene, the Flats where entirely covered in heather and gorse. Due to
the farming talents of the [Halfling](Halflings.md "wikilink") race,
however, the Flats have been transformed into one of the most productive
farming towns in the Realm. Recently however, a local strong-arm has
moved onto the flats and claimed them for his own, keeping the
[Halflings](Halflings.md "wikilink") in check with a band of
[Orken](Orcs.md "wikilink") thugs.*
