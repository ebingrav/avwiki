*Heather Flats is the name of a small [Halfling](Halflings "wikilink")
farming village south of the Dwarven Trade Route. It got its name
because when the first settlers arrived on the scene, the Flats where
entirely covered in heather and gorse. Due to the farming talents of the
[Halfling](Halflings "wikilink") race, however, the Flats have been
transformed into one of the most productive farming towns in the Realm.
Recently however, a local strong-arm has moved onto the flats and
claimed them for his own, keeping the [Halflings](Halflings "wikilink")
in check with a band of [Orken](Orcs "wikilink") thugs.*
