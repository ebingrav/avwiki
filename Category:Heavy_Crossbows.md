*Heavy crossbows do more damage than [light
ones](:Category:_Light_Crossbows "wikilink"), and can perform
[longshot](Longshot "wikilink"), but not
[scattershot](Scattershot "wikilink"). They suffer a small penalty to
usage in direct melee, but are complex and time consuming to reload.
They are the only bows that can be used to [parry](Parry "wikilink").*

Heavy Crossbows have the annoying habit of failing to reload, causing
you to not shoot that round.
