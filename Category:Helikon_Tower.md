*After [Tannah Machadae](Tannah_Machadae "wikilink")'s army sacked
[Ofcol](:Category:Ofcol.md "wikilink"), and she took her residence in
the [newly created town](:Category:Cathracharraig.md "wikilink") and
[tower](:Category:Daingean_Machadae.md "wikilink"), she allowed her
former lieutenant [Lezgnar](Lezgnar "wikilink") to start a life of his
own at her old tower. She reshaped it, until all was fine and dandy, and
now Lezgnar, together with his wife [Shaybl](Shaybl "wikilink"), rules
this region of the land in the name of Mistress Mach.*
