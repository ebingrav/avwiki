## Recommended Gear

(values in parenthesis represent HR/DR)

<sup>(1)</sup> If you use two weapons, it's recommended to use
[Leviathan Scale](Leviathan_Scale "wikilink") to bash, because of its DR
bonus.

<sup>(2)</sup> Although only 4 DR the [Shard Of Black Doom
Marble](Shard_Of_Black_Doom_Marble "wikilink") and the [Orb Of Amorphous
Essence](Orb_Of_Amorphous_Essence "wikilink") are both weapons and can
be enchanted up to 12 DR, with 10 DR being the average used(see each
page for details).  
<sup>(3)</sup> Can be modified for +2% melee power.

Obtaining two 10 DR weapons (which are easier to obtain than most 11 DR
weapons), a 10 DR held such as a 10/10 [Shard Of Black Doom
Marble](Shard_Of_Black_Doom_Marble "wikilink"), and the best DR item of
each slot (except [Girth Of The Most
Holy](Girth_Of_The_Most_Holy "wikilink")) will increase your DR by 86
above your race's natural DR.

To further improve DR you must upgrade your Weapons and Held (see
<sup>(2)</sup> above) by using [Enchant
Weapon](Enchant_Weapon "wikilink") (never Enchant anything you can't
replace yourself). Doing this can take considerable farming and
enchanting time, but you can add a 12 DR Held and two 14 DR weapons (or,
as is common 14 DR wield and 15 DR offhand), which will of course add
another 10 or 11 DR respectively.
