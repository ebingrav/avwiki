*On AVATAR, we have a rather unique group of players called heroes.
Heroes are those individuals who have attained [level](Level "wikilink")
51. They are still considered mortal under AVATAR rules, but they
command much more power than players of [level](Level "wikilink") 1-50.
Heroes have no set role within AVATAR society; rather, it is what they
make of it. Some heroes choose to use their strength to help other
players with [corpse retrievals](Corpse_Retrieval "wikilink") and
various sundry requests. Other heroes enjoy running
[quests](Quests "wikilink"). Still others avoid involvement with [the
lower levels](:Category:_Lowmort "wikilink") and instead focus on
attaining more power. Irrespective of a hero's chosen role, he or she is
still subject to all the rules, like any player on AVATAR. There is
nothing wrong with asking a hero to give you a hand with anything; they
too are mortals. However, the choice to help you is entirely their own.
It is NOT acceptable to beg and pester a Hero (or anyone else) who
doesn't want to help you - that isn't their job. They may be busy with
other things, and harassment will not be tolerated. Heroes are a great
asset to AVATAR, and helpful in many ways. Please treat them with the
respect they deserve.*
