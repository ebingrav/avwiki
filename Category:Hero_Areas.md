## Recommended Areas

Popular areas for lowhero groups to gain experience include [Dream
Steppes](:Category:_Dream_Steppes.md "wikilink"), the upper part of
[Greed's Gallows](:Category:_Greed's_Gallows.md "wikilink"), [Hamlet of
Kreigstadt](:Category:_Hamlet_Of_Kreigstadt.md "wikilink"),
[Igecsoz](:Category:_Igecsoz.md "wikilink")' Trog Market and Fortress
Keep portions, and [Tortuga Cay](:Category:_Tortuga_Cay.md "wikilink")
(for spellcasters, mon/shf or bzk). What these areas have in common is
that they're uncursed and (except for Dream Steppes and a few mobs in
Tortuga Cay) unaggie, which makes CRs, which are frequent at lowhero,
way easier if the entire group goes down.

The [Deepways](Deepways "wikilink") is a popular area for smaller groups
(3 or less). It has a large variety of mobs, many of which spawn a
larger version on death. Most are not aggie. A lot of the area is cursed
but if you use the map you can learn where un-cursed rooms are scattered
about for setting recall.

Popular areas for highhero groups to gain experience include [The Great
Divide](:Category:_Great_Divide.md "wikilink") and [ Morte
Vallta](:Category:_Morte_Vallta.md "wikilink").
