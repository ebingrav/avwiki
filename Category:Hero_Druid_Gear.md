## Recommended Gear

These items have the hitroll, for archer damage, and mana, for druid
spellcasting.  
Some druids may prefer to run in [pure archer
gear](:Category:_Hero_Archer_Gear.md "wikilink"), or [pure mana
gear](:Category:_Hero_Mana_Gear.md "wikilink") with the addition of a
bow and arrows.
