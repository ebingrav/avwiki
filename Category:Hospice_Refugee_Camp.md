*[Captain Jacklyn](Captain_Jacklyn "wikilink") was eventually able to
lead the citizens of [Ofcol](:Category:Ofcol.md "wikilink") to a retreat
from the city, only just in time as it seemed. When he did so there was
a need for healing, so the doors of [Tul-Sith's
Hospice](:Category:Tul-Sith's_Hospice.md "wikilink") were opened to the
many refugees who needed curing of various ailments. A special camp was
set up out back the Hospice where healers have travelled from all over
Midgaardia to offer their services.*

Area is very small and has a simple east-west layout. No rooms are
cursed.

## Adventuring

Of special interest is the [Ancient Gold
Dragon](Ancient_Gold_Dragon "wikilink"), which is lvl 37 (watch out
lowmorts!) and carries the [Gold Dragon
Orb](Gold_Dragon_Orb "wikilink"), an excellent healing brand.

Aside from the dragon, the local populace is generally good aligned and
does not provide much xp due to low numbers.

Go here for the orb and other Ofcol gear.
