''A gilded street in [
Cathracharraig](:Category:Cathracharraig "wikilink"), the street paved
from solid gold: framed on the northern edge by the foothills of Devil's
Peak, furtive glances and secretive movements come from its inhabitants.

''At its western end, huddled in the shadows and stones of Devil's Peak
stands a building whose edifice undeniably shows the abundance of money
of the owner with an eccentric entrance: a hole carved out of a boulder
which was once the end of the road. Yet the expected invitations to the
thought-to-be-inevitable parties did not arrive at the houses of the
other rich and noble of the town. Rumors were spread to provoke some
reaction, but nothing happened apart from the even further elaboration
of the ugly grimaces and creatures adorning the passage into the gloomy
courtyard of the mansion.

*Interest has slackened since the fall of [
Ofcol](:Category:Ofcol "wikilink"), and the House of Stone fills its
dark spot, mostly ignored, only rarely mentioned in connection with
shady companies arriving and leaving in dark moonless nights, and the
sounds of stonemasons chiseling and carving.*

**Level Range:** 43-45

**Builder:** Pico
