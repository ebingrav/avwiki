*The Iceways are a series of tunnels that were dug long ago by the
[Dwarves](Dwarves.md "wikilink"). They start from several different
points across the realm, and all end up near the frontier town of
[Icewolf](:Category:_Icewolf.md "wikilink"). The stories say that as the
[Dwarves](Dwarves.md "wikilink") got further north, the rock they dug
gave way to ice, which was how it was learned that
[Icewolf](:Category:_Icewolf.md "wikilink") actually sits upon a
permanently frozen portion of Lake Tarnas. Several years ago, excessive
magical activity in Devil's Peak shook the nearby Iceways and caused
part of the ice therein to melt. Rather than let the rest of their mines
be flooded, the [Dwarves](Dwarves.md "wikilink") of [Mt
Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr.md "wikilink") sealed all six Iceways, trapping
a crew of workers inside. Today, at least one of the Iceways has been
reopened, but some say the drowned miners still haunt the tunnels.
Whether they do or not, the Iceways are the only way to travel to or
from the northern frontier.*
