*Located in the Northern Frontier the town of Icewolf stands as the
center of trade in the North. The path through the mountains has been,
for years, blocked by landslide. The Pass been re-opened through the
diligent efforts of both the citizens of the now-destroyed
[Ofcol](:Category:Ofcol.md "wikilink") and Icewolf. Now a steady flow of
caravans laden with goods travel the Pass. Perhaps more importantly, a
new realm of adventure is open to those brave enough to venture into the
Northern Frontier.*

## Adventuring

There isn't much here for heroes. Icytree (sanc'ed, hero level) and the
Elder Wehr (also sanc'ed) can provide a modicum of experience, as will
the quest mob in the hidden part southeast of Big Fish, who is involved
in the Dragon's Whisker quest. Otherwise, good experience for 35-42.
