An alphabetical list of all AVATAR MUD identifiers.

*If you can find a shopkeeper who is willing, you can pay a price to
have them [identify](Identify_(spell) "wikilink")
[items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") for you. What is the cost?
Roughly 10 times whatever the [level](Object_Level "wikilink") of the
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") is how much it'll cost you. What
does it do? It gives you information about the
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"), of course.
[Weight](Object_Weight "wikilink"), what it is, and more can be seen
with this spell and shop ability. If you add "appraise" after the
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") name, you will learn how much
[gold](Gold_In_Hand "wikilink") it will cost to
[identify](Identify_(spell) "wikilink").*
