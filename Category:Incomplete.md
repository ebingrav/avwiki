This is a list of all the categories and pages that have been started
but could use some extra attention. If you need to explain why a
particular category or page is incomplete, then you may do so on its
Discussion page.

If you're feeling helpful, then feel free to fill up some of the
categories or pages below with more useful information. If you feel that
your changes have made a category or page "complete" then please remove
it from this category.

Area categories here have blank sections in them that need filling. Gear
and mob pages here are missing various bits of useful information (see
[Templates](:Category:_Templates.md "wikilink") for recommendations
about what information a "complete" page should include).
