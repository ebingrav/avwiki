"Insignia Quests" are special types of ticket quests that are written
into areas, do not require any staff or other players to set up, and
reset themseves along with the rest of the area. At the end of such
quests, one receives an insignia for completion. Some insignia add
perminant or fading bonuses. These quests can usually only be completed
once. These quests typically begin with a mob asking you to perform a
series of tasks in increasing difficulty until the insignia is earned.
Since these quests are based on scripts, these quests do not always
follow the standard ticket quest style.
