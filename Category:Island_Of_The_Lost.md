## Connections

-   [Sea Of Strayed Hopes](:Category:Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes "wikilink")

## Navigation

The area starts at the entrance from the sea of strayed hopes. At the
end of the section is a fountain. Quaffing from the fountain will take
you to a series of 2x2 islands each with two fountains that can lead to
other 2x2 islands. There are a total of eight islands which ultimately
lead to a stretch of land and room with 4-5 samurai. All areas after the
initial area are cursed and the mobs are [aggie](Aggressive "wikilink").
The only other safe, non-cursed room is the first room in the last
section. A sword is in the last section's mob room.

Each fountain takes you to a specific part of the area depending on its
description:

## Adventuring

Decent area for solo/duo. There's too much quaffing from fountains for a
larger group to keep up the pace. Mob density is low, and only a few of
them give good xp. On top of that they wield, cast and stab.

## Affects

As of October 2011, the area features a sizable increase in experience
gains, an increase in hp regeneration, and a less loss of self on death.
