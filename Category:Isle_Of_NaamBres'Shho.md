*It is said, that an isle lies in the
[sea](:Category:_Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes "wikilink") not that far away,
full of strange things and beings sparked alive by a strong power.
Crystal statues are depicting people of a kingdom there. A kingdom that
might still exist, but far away. Some historians claim that once it
stretched to this region of the world, unlikely as it is. And that it
shrank and is known now by a different name, if at all. Be it as it may,
the island kept the memory. Statues and domes, the silent remnants of a
bygone time. And a word from books almost forgotten: NaamBres'Shho.*

This [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") was the winner of an
[area-building contest](Area-Building_Contests "wikilink") in 2004.  
This [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") was added in 2005.  

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 37s, 3e, s, e (note:
crosses [water terrain](Water_Terrain "wikilink")).

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [NaamSa
scribe](Scribe "wikilink").

## Connections

-   [Sea Of Strayed Hopes](:Category:Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes "wikilink")
    ([Map](Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes_Map "wikilink"))

## Navigation

The area is made of the following parts:

-   Surface layer which is uncursed, made of water and land rooms,
-   Part beneath the statues, mostly water, all cursed,
-   Part beneath golden shields, all water, fully cursed with a
    detonator and corpse reanimator.
-   Silver crystal sphere, a small set of rooms directly connecting all
    three parts, providing you have appropriate keys.

Getting under statues requires pushing appropriate body parts (mouth,
eyes, ears, depending on statue). Once below you can appropriate golden
discs which are keys to get to under the golden shields part.

The crystal sphere is accessible from any lower layer providing you can
either push body parts or have keys.

## Adventuring

Parts of this area are appropriate for regular xp runs (below statues,
crabs and other creatures on surface layer). The *other* lower part is
ok as well if you are careful to either avoid [Swarm Of
Crystals](Swarm_Of_Crystals "wikilink") (detonator) and [Hopes Of
Remembrance](Hopes_Of_Remembrance "wikilink") (animator), or dispatch
them quickly and nakedly.

However, this is a quest area, first and foremost. It's built from the
grounds up to support a single involved
[quest](NaamAhn'Sa_Token_Quest "wikilink"), so perhaps it'd perhaps be
best enjoyed by a large explorer or a group doing the said quest.

## Comments

To answer the opening text's unasked question: "A kingdom that might
still exist, but far away. Some historians claim that once it stretched
to this region of the world, unlikely as it is. And that it shrank and
is known now by a different name, if at all."

Yes, the kingdom does indeed exist but it's far from what it once was.
In fact the kingdom's remnants can be found in [Odevar
Hills](:Category:Odevar_Hills "wikilink"), along with some artifacts of
the ages gone by, should you spare time to do some archeology there.

The [Black Jellyfish](Black_Jellyfish "wikilink") will throw a [Black
Tentacle](Black_Tentacle "wikilink"), a very heavy [throwing
weapon](:Category:_Throwing_Weapons "wikilink").
