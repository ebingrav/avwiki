*"Death from above, death from below,*  
*corruption shall find ye, hide or not.*  
*Ocean rots, earth dies, sun chars, cold kills.*  
*Wickedness abounds, death walks,*  
*fury and anger strong, love is lost.*  
*The light and the dark shall perish*  
*with only chaos abloom.*  
*So it shall be."*

*Every seer, mystic, witch, warlock, anyone with the slightest
soothsaying ability awoke together with these words on their lips.*

*And so it has come to pass, the once lush, verdant surface of Karnath
has withered, strange creatures have appeared, rational men have gone
mad... all manner of catastrophes have taken place. All is not lost;
there are still pockets of resistance to the chaos, but they are few and
far between. Even the powerful magics of Fluent to the west and Aziz-Ra
to the north have could not save their followers from the disaster. They
have withdrawn from Karnath proper, isolating themselves in the
fortresses as they work to stem the tide of corruption.*

*If you choose to journey to this harsh place, fare thee well... but
don't forget to kiss your loved one goodbye before you go.*
