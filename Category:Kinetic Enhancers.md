"The best time to assault your enemy's mind is when his flesh is being
torn asunder." - Relluri, psion adept.

Powerful psionicists have developed a technique to imbue their weapons
with latent psionic energy. This allows the weapons to attack a victim's
mind in addition to their body.

This is a delicate art. Weapons need a certain degree of freedom to be
able to launch psionic attacks. Hence, these mental attacks only occur
when the weapons are controlled with telekinesis.

In general, a psionicist can only imbue a single type of psionic attack
into their weapons at a time. Some more advanced techniques are less
likely to conflict.
