''West of [Cathracharraig](Cathracharraig "wikilink"), South of the
Mountains, and North of the Dwarven Trade Route, there lies the Kingdom
of the Willows. It is home to the Great Hall of Spiriel, ruling seat of
the Kings of [Elves](Elves "wikilink") since Ancient Days, when the Fae
themselves walked the Mortal World.

''The [High Elves](High_Elves "wikilink") now are dwindling, and only a
few still dwell under the Willows, singing sadly of the bygone times as
their land is consumed by the lesser kiths of the World.

*The territory of the Kingdom of the Willows extends from [Lloth's
Peak](:Category:_Lloth's_Peak "wikilink") to Devil's Peak and reaches
south to the borders of [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") in
the east, and south to [Crystalmir
Lake](:Category:_Crystalmir_Lake "wikilink") in the west. However, the
decline of the High Elves has limited the Kingdom's control severely,
mostly to the large royal gardens southwest of Cathracharraig, due north
of the halfling village of [Heather
Flats](:Category:_Heather_Flats "wikilink").*

The Kingdom of the Willows lies hidden deep within the woods west of
[Ofcol](:Category:_Ofcol "wikilink"). [Elves](Elves "wikilink") are the
inhabitants of this green city, fighting back the
[Orcs](Orcs "wikilink"), lost in thoughts about the old and glorious
times of their race.
