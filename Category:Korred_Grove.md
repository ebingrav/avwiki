*Within the [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink") forest is a
pleasant grove that is rather a paradox amidst the danger of
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink"). It is rumored to be the
home of a wily bunch of nature-loving humanoids called korred. However,
it seems that a malevolent [wizard](:Category:_Wizards.md "wikilink")
has set his sights on something that the korred are protecting, and they
are quite the territorial bunch. He has recruited a band of evil
[trolls](Trolls.md "wikilink") to aid him in capturing this item, but
the korred haven't given way yet.*

**Level Range:** 25-35
