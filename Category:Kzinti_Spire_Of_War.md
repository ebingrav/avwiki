*Deep within the Savage Jungle stand twin spires, the icons of kzinti
civilization. They stand tall at the northern edge of the Valley of the
Spires, a place that can only be entered by climbing around Inferno
Peak. The spires represent aspects of kzinti beliefs. The eastern tower
is the Spire of Knowledge, where scientists and sorcerers study, as well
as where kzinti religion is based. The western tower is the Spire of
War, the core of kzinti civilization, wherein the kzinti military and
rulers reside.*
