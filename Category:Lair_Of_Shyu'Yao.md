her power and beauty are as great as her evil. It is said that she
dwells deep beneath the earth and preys on the souls of the unwary.*

## Navigation

The area is very small, just 25 rooms. These are divided into regular
*questline* passages, and there is a small 2x2x2 looping maze. Overall
the area is not difficult to memorize.

Only the first room is uncursed, so those without portal or teleport
will have to run the area to its conclusion to get out.

## Adventuring

This is a quest area, built around the main item - the [Glyph of
Tao](Glyph_Of_Tao_(1_of_2).md "wikilink"). As such, it is very small,
has a low amount of mobs, not all of which are aggie, and most of which
do not see hidden characters.

Levels of the mobs are appropriate for lowhero soloing or even high
lowmort groups.

To exit the area, aside for teleportation or portalling out, the player
will need to finish the quest and simply walk out to the entrance room,
which is uncursed.
