*In the far north, near the top of the world, there is a vast expanse of
water that has become known as the Lake of Tears. Many stories surround
the lake, the most well known dates back to the time of the first wars,
and the death of Kisestre. Merrighand, the God of Wonder and father of
Kisestre, learned of her death, and began to weep. He wept for fully a
year, before departing for another realm, leaving behind a vast body of
water. Straul Warmaker, still full of wrath about Kisestre, knew the
power of a god's tears, and filled the lake with leviathan spawn, which
still fill the lake. The only predators of the leviathan are an ancient
race of [gryphons](Griffons "wikilink"), hunting from a mountain aerie.*

## Navigation

This area is simply laid out. The upper portion is a simple 8x4 grid
with outliers. The second level is smaller but follows the upper layer
closely. There is a small loop at the southern end of the second layer.
The third level is only three rooms, and the fourth layer is where
[Ouroburoses](Ouroburos "wikilink") can be found. The last
[Ouroburos](Ouroburos "wikilink") in the cave has the [Ouroburos'
Tail](Ouroburos'_Tail "wikilink").

## Adventuring

Good experience, everything is worth killing. Down at the bottom are a
trio of [Ouroburos](Ouroburos "wikilink") that can really hurt,
otherwise everything is pretty wimpy. The leviathans are tougher
according to age, so [baby leviathans](Baby_Leviathan "wikilink") aren't
that big, but [adults](Adult_Leviathan "wikilink") are nice a juicy.
They'll tail you from time to time, so watch out. Make sure you keep
water up, and other than that, kill away.
