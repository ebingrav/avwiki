*During the second great war between the [Ents](Ents.md "wikilink") and
the [Giants](Giants.md "wikilink"), the [demon](Demons.md "wikilink")
god Glasya discovered a location of great tactical advantage. A large
drop in the landscape had developed over time in the east, in the land
that today is [Midgaard
Country](:Category:_Midgaard_Country.md "wikilink"). At the bottom of
this decline was a small trench, surrounded by rocky slopes that were
practically impassable by the [Ents](Ents.md "wikilink") themselves.
Once occupied, the trench proved unapproachable for the
[elves](Elves.md "wikilink") as well, who ended up getting picked off by
the [giants](Giants.md "wikilink") as they attempted to descend the
slopes. Glasya had built a sturdy iron bunker at the bottom of this
low-lying portion of the landscape, and from within he performed a
plethora of vile and corrupt acts against the
[Ents](Ents.md "wikilink"). It is said that he used a scrying pool and a
summoning platform to cause the [Ents](Ents.md "wikilink") great
distress in their own forests. The [Ents](Ents.md "wikilink"), however,
could not withstand Glasya's perversions for very much longer. Their
only course of action was to find a way to bury the trench and stop
Glasya's assault from within. Every attempt to collapse the trench was
met with Glasya's plantlife perversions crawling up the slopes and
solidifying the walls. The [Ents](Ents.md "wikilink") were at an impass,
but not for long. A wise [Ent](Ents.md "wikilink") had been studying the
areas to the north, where great mountains rose into the skies. Within
this mountain range was a frigid lake of mountain water. Behind Glasya's
back, the [Ents](Ents.md "wikilink") molded the land to create a
waterfall, and slowly sunk the ground on a path towards the trench.
Without warning, the waters of the lake rushed down from the mountains
and engulfed the trench, several [giants](Giants.md "wikilink"), and the
bunker itself. To the [Ents](Ents.md "wikilink") dismay, the
[demon](Demons.md "wikilink") god was not present, but the bunker was
magically sealed and buried under a flood of frigid water. All inside
were lost.*
