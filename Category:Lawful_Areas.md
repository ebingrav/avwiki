*Many years ago, the king of [Midgaard
City](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink") contracted with a powerful
security cartel to provide indefinite protective services for the area.
Over time, this hired help has evolved from a band of thugs into a
sizable group of [city guards](Townguard_Mobs.md "wikilink") and elite
enforcers. A misanthropic [jailer](Jailer_Mobs.md "wikilink") wields
executive power over detainees in cramped, dirty
[facilities](Jail_Rooms.md "wikilink") that are a relic of the original
Midgaardian settlement. The city's
[executioner](Executioner_Mobs.md "wikilink") is a morbid fellow with
sadistic tendencies. It's all a bit savage, but the system ensures that
the rules are mostly followed; and the
[guards](Townguard_Mobs.md "wikilink") extend protection to all
law-abiding [citizens](Citizen_Mobs.md "wikilink").*

*Recently, a distant cousin of the
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink")
[executioner](Executioner_Mobs.md "wikilink") settled into
[Mervue](:Category:_Mervue.md "wikilink"). Shortly thereafter, for
unspecified reasons, the mayor made several rather drastic changes to
the city's legal code. The [Mervue](:Category:_Mervue.md "wikilink")
[executioner](Executioner_Mobs.md "wikilink") hired an appropriately
cruel [person](Jailer_Mobs.md "wikilink") to manage the two-cell
[prison](Jail_Rooms.md "wikilink"), and
[citizens](Citizen_Mobs.md "wikilink") of
[Mervue](:Category:_Mervue.md "wikilink") are now subject to the same
draconian "protections" provided to
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink")
[citizens](Citizen_Mobs.md "wikilink").*

*Wronging a [citizen](Citizen_Mobs.md "wikilink") under the protection
of a lawful city will cause you to branded as an
[OUTLAW](Outlaw_Flag.md "wikilink") almost immediately, and punishment
is sure to follow if you are caught.*

*Membership in a law-bound state is not a matter of physical appearance
but a state of mind; properly trained
[psionicists](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") have found a way to
[discern](Bioscan.md "wikilink") whether a person holds such allegiance.
Those trained in the [ways](Rogue_Lore.md "wikilink") of
[rogues](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") can also discern whether a
person's mannerisms are those of a conscientious
[citizen](Citizen_Mobs.md "wikilink").*
