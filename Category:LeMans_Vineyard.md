*Alonso LeMans was the last in a long line of Midgaardian Nobility,
famous as humanity's foremost viniculturists. When
[humans](Humans.md "wikilink") began expanding eastward into
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink"), with the construction of
the farms of [Midgaard
Country](:Category:_Midgaard_Country.md "wikilink"), LeMans lept ahead
and started culling acres of forest to build a massive vineyard and
mansion. But apparently the Guardians of the Forest were not pleased. A
terrible curse befell LeMans, and all those inside his mansion, but that
is another story. The [Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink") was constructed to
keep the evil magics of [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink")
out of [Midgaard Country](:Category:_Midgaard_Country.md "wikilink"),
with LeMans' mansion on one side, and the vineyard on the other. Since
then, a dark magic has crept into the vineyard from the nearby lake,
infusing the vines with evil sentience. A band of marauding
[Orcs](Orcs.md "wikilink") have also made the vineyards their base from
which to plunder the nearby farms. For these reasons, many local
residents are begining to wish the
[Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink") had been built a
lot further west.*
