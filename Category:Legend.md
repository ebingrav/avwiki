''Very rarely, an adventurer of great renown may advance in prowess and
in experience beyond the trappings and the confinement of Lordly
stature. Such a player has transgressed the boundaries of existence as
it is commonly known, has developed a new consciousness of the many
planes of existence, and in the process has become a living Legend.

*Though a few, it is rumored, have advanced to this highly advanced
state by means of divine intervention or perverse abuses of magical
power, to legitimately effect the transformation requires unfathomably
mysterious fortitude.*

*<b>\* Please note that all Legends are required to multiregister.</b>*
