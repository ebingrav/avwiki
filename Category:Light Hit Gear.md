This article is for the benefit of those who are seeking **Hit** gear
for the **Used As Light** slot, but are not neccessarily interested in
what the 'best' gear is for their level.

There may be many reasons for this, but at least one is that gear which
has a mix of qualities may be desired and as such sacrificing a certain
amount of hit or dam for other increases, such as mana or AC benefits,
could prove beneficial. This could be useful for a character who runs
solo and as such may desire a particular balance of gear, or even those
who would like to hit a little bit harder without sacrificing so much of
their mana.

## Hit Gear for the Used As Light Slot:
