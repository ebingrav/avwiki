*Light crossbows are extremely easy to use, and suffer no penalty when
used in direct combat. However, they cannot perform the
[longshot](Longshot.md "wikilink") or
[scattershot](Scattershot.md "wikilink") skills. One of the advantages
to both crossbow types is that [bolts](:Category:_Bolts.md "wikilink")
are sturdier than [arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink") and have a
higher survival rate.*

Light crossbows suffer no penalty in direct combat, and are probably the
best choice for soloing in my humble opinion. Other choices for soloing
are [Heavy Crossbows](:Category:_Heavy_Crossbows.md "wikilink") and
[Guns](:Category:Guns.md "wikilink").
