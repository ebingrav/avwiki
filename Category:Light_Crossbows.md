*Light crossbows are extremely easy to use, and suffer no penalty when
used in direct combat. However, they cannot perform the
[longshot](Longshot "wikilink") or [scattershot](Scattershot "wikilink")
skills. One of the advantages to both crossbow types is that
[bolts](:Category:_Bolts "wikilink") are sturdier than
[arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink") and have a higher survival rate.*

Light crossbows suffer no penalty in direct combat, and are probably the
best choice for soloing in my humble opinion. Other choices for soloing
are [Heavy Crossbows](:Category:_Heavy_Crossbows "wikilink") and
[Guns](:Category:Guns "wikilink").
