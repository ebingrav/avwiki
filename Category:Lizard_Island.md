*Located in a tropical island chain of the
[ocean](:Category:_Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes.md "wikilink") controlled by
[Lord Audis](Lord_Audis.md "wikilink"), the island of the lizard king is
devoid of the normal chain of civilization. Instead the local
[lizardmen](Lizardmen.md "wikilink") fight amongst each other for every
scrap of food they can find. Most shipping fleets find the island safe
to land on after [Lord Audis](Lord_Audis.md "wikilink") and his men
conquered the island and forcing the lizard king to agree never to
attack another vessel in the waters or on the beach again. In return,
stewardship of the eastern and less hospitable side of the island was
granted to the lizard king and his people. The pirates collect a price
from the leader of these people to keep the lizard king well supplied
enough to control his subjects and maintain his throne.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

**Builder:** Flinn

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink"): 37s, 5e (note:

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [island
guard](Island_Guardsman.md "wikilink").

## Connections

-   [Sea Of Strayed Hopes](:Category:Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes.md "wikilink")
    ([map](Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes_Map.md "wikilink"))

## Navigation

Island is generally banana-shaped:

-   Beaches and the beginning of the trail - western part of the island
    (pp [island guard](Island_Guardsman.md "wikilink")), uncursed
-   The forest - middle part, cursed,
-   The Lizardman village, to the south, cursed.

## Adventuring

The island is mostly visited for its [Hairy
Tarantula](Hairy_Tarantula "wikilink"), which carries the [venom
gland](Tarantula's_Venom_Gland.md "wikilink"), useful for poisoning
weapons.

Watch out for the aggressive [Rock Lizard](Rock_Lizard "wikilink") near
the [Island Guards](Island_Guardsman.md "wikilink") (e e n) as he is
significantly beefier than most of the other mobs near him.

There are several variations of [Lizardman
Hunter](Lizardman_Hunter_(Lizard_Island).md "wikilink") who are pretty
weak and which wield either a spear or shortsword. The [Lizardman
Headhunter](Lizardman_Headhunter "wikilink") is the same level (62) but
he hits a bit harder because he has better gear. Both sneak and are evil
aligned. The [Glow Moth](Glow_Moth "wikilink") (on scan: A strange
insect glows in the darkness) are pretty weak as they are only level 55
and affected by [Faerie Fire](Faerie_Fire "wikilink") (pink aura) â€“ they
wear the treasure item [glow moth wings](Glow_Moth_Wings.md "wikilink").

Forest part and the Village are aggie. The two [mutant
lizardmen](Mutant_Lizardman.md "wikilink") before the village carry the
key to the King, but the door can be passed using [Pass
Door](Pass_Door "wikilink"). On the south-western portion of the village
(2x2 square), the Divine Tree is an anti-magic room.

[Scrub The Lizard King](Scrub_The_Lizard_King "wikilink") is behind the
locked door with two more [mutant
lizardmen](Mutant_Lizardman.md "wikilink"). South is his pet
[Tosskah](Tosskah "wikilink") behind a hidden door, and from there
downwards are a few pirates.
