*The Volcano itself has been inactive for many centuries, but the inside
of its crater has many winding, dank tunnels that are the perfect
nesting place for a band of harpies that feed on the young of the nearby
[elven](Elves "wikilink") settlements. Rumor has it there is something
even darker in Lloth's Peak, dwelling beneath the harpies and deeper
inside the earth.*
