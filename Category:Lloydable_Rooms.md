Lloydable Rooms are special rooms scattered around the plane in which
lords are capable of using the skills [Safe
Haven](Safe_Haven "wikilink"), [Planar
Anchor](Planar_Anchor "wikilink"), [Create
Shrine](Create_Shrine "wikilink") or Pure/Holy Spring. These are
commonly used as alternate shifting points in many locations to bypass
otherwise dangerous shifts, allowing further groupies to join or
otherwise save time.

Based on 'Lloyd's Beacon', a Lloydable flag on a room will allow a
player to set their recall when outside the Midgaardian Plane. (Given
there isn't another flag like 'no recall' preventing you, of course.) It
is also a magical focal point for spells such as [Safe
Haven](Safe_Haven "wikilink").

Similar to the Infirmary flag visible to clerics, the Lloydable flag is
visible to [Rangers](Rangers "wikilink") only. It is possible to detect
it with the [use of magic](Detect_Haven "wikilink").

See [Planar Anchor](Planar_Anchor "wikilink") for an index of known
Lloydable rooms.
