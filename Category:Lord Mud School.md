*The Lord mudschool was designed with several purposes in mind:*

*- Teach new Lords about the basics of the Lord tier, what to expect and
what prepare for.*

*- Give an introduction to each class at the Lord tier, suggestions for
playing them, and how they survive at Lord.*

*- To reward the new Lords for their effort by giving them a practice
ticket.*

*Any Lord can walk through the mudschool at any level; the entrance is
located 2s from the Center of Thorngate Square. If you see a true newbie
morph, please show them the mudschool. Being available to them to answer
questions they may have is a very good idea too. We have all been in
their situation and needed a helping hand through the transition
period.*

*Send any comments, updates or bug reports to the Immortals through the
bug, idea, or typo commands.*
