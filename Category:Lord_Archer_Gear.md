Some of the lord hitgear has hr mods as well, which can be used in place
of the pieces listed above.  
Also, archer mods are based on an item's level, so you can also enchant
hero archer gear with archer mods up to lord level, and use that
effectively until you get actual lord archer gear.

Areas](:Category:Shard_Area_Gear "wikilink").</small>

<sup>1</sup><small>The strength bonus on this item might be useful for
users of heavily restrung bows in some situations.</small>
