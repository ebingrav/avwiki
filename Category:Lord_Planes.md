A plane is a separate plane of existence. Up until lord a lowmort or
hero existed on the [Midgaardia](:Category:_Midgaardia "wikilink") plane
(except the locker rental room). However, once they ascent to lord they
are transferred to [Thorngate](:Category:_Thorngate "wikilink") and
learn to transfer between planes with
[Planeshift](Planeshift "wikilink") and a key word representing that
plane or a special artifact called the [Planar
Anchor](Planar_Anchor "wikilink") which can be placed in certain
locations. Each plane has one room you are shifted to. In the case of
Midgaardia that is the room [Zin](Zin "wikilink") is in at the [Trials
Of Zin](:Category:_Trials_Of_Zin "wikilink").
