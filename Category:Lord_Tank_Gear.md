<sup>1</sup> Manifest Gear  
<sup>2</sup> Shard Area Gear  
<sup>3</sup> Similar to several pieces listed here, although the [Shield
Of Shadows](Shield_Of_Shadows "wikilink") has less ac than the [Shield
Of Lords](Shield_Of_Lords "wikilink") it has a nice
[saves](Saving_Throw "wikilink") bonus (which might be more useful than
the lost ac at lord â€“ see [ Armor Class Advice for Lord
Tanks](Armor_Class "wikilink")).  
<sup>4</sup> Although not the best AC wise (-18) some people prefer to
use runed lord weapons for wields namely the [Astral
Longsword](Astral_Longsword "wikilink") as it is an [Ethereal
weapon](:Category:Ethereal_Weapons "wikilink") so it can not be disarmed
or the [Ethereal Blade](Ethereal_Blade "wikilink") which has saves but
despite the name is not an [Ethereal
weapon](:Category:Ethereal_Weapons "wikilink").
