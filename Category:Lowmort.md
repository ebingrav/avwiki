One of the things people notice about Avatar is that it has a tiered
leveling system. Anyone entering the mud starts as a low mortal (or
lowmort). The lowmort tier runs from level 1 to 50, and at level 51 you
become a hero.

Each tier has certain responsibilities. As a lowmort, it is your
responsibility to learn about the game and how to play your chosen race
and class. This is a time to learn the mud and to explore its many
possibilities.

As a lowmort, feel free to roam the mud and learn where to go to get
experience and become well equipped. Feel free to ask for help on chat.
Though most people won't get you equipment they may help you find it.
The thrill of lowmort is in the learning and exploration. Take advantage
of your time at this tier and experiment with different equipment and
areas.

At some point in your lowmort travels you may find you need help with
your outings (often called runs). Then you will know it's time to group
with your fellow low mortals. Groups may not be easy to come by, but
you'll find that the more you run, the more friends you'll make, and the
more groups you'll be asked into.

Just remember to enjoy your time at lowmort, and never be afraid to ask
for help or advice! Good luck and good hunting!
