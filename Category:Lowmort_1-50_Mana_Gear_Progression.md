## Recommended Gear Progression

Notes about the progression lists below:

-   Numbers in () indicate the lowest level the item pops at.
-   Items wearable at level 50 will eventually be included even if they
    are considered Hero gear but an 'H' will be included in the () to
    indicate this.
-   The list doesn't consider alternative items of lesser worth. Only
    the most effective item at a given level is listed. See the level
    range specific pages for alternative or easier to obtain items.
-   Grandfathered items are also not included in this list. Again see
    the level range specific lists for grandfathered gear you can try
    begging someone for.
-   Items with (Fade) after them MAY require fading before use
