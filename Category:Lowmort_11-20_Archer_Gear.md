## Recommended Gear

## Comments

At this level, archers should probably consider using [melee
weapons](:Category:Lowmort_11-20_Melee_Weapons "wikilink") and [focus on
their dr](:Category:Lowmort_11-20_Hit_Gear "wikilink"), as one is
usually soloing at this point, and hand cross bows are pretty weak at
this point, compared to what is possible with melee weapons. Once you
have access to [Target Leading](Target_Leading "wikilink") you should
definitely use a bow. If you do use archer gear and a hand crossbow
remember to enchant the archer modifier gear ([Woven Grass
Bracelet](Woven_Grass_Bracelet "wikilink"), [Buck-Skin
Gloves](Buck-Skin_Gloves "wikilink")) with an alt as the modifier is
based on the items level.
