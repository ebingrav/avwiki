So you have made it through the trials of the twenties. Don't start to
rest, the road has just begun to be difficult. The thirties is the level
range in which most players become dependent upon groups. Don't be
frustrated if you find you by yourself can only kill one measely mob per
regen session - that's how this range is set up. This is where you
really begin learning about the various group roles which will become
essential for the rest of the game. At the same time, this is where you
will discover what role you prefer to fill. Do you like leading the
charge and taking all the hits while your friends beat the poor goblins
to death? Do you like hiding behind a beefcake and striking your foe
while it's trying to kill your buddy? Or do you wish to see no more of
this violence, instead opting to aid your comrades in their endeavors?

At [level](Level "wikilink") 35, you can customize the message that
other players see whenever you enter or exit whatever room they are in
(see [Setmin](Setmin "wikilink") and [Setmout](Setmout "wikilink")).
