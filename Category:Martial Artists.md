*The martial artist class was an old class of men and women who have
mastered both the skills of hand-to-hand combat and the ability to wield
magic. Their life, from a very young age, was spent in study in a dojo
or monastery. At the age of 17, the masters of the martial artist
student encourage him to leave the cloistered life and explore the
world.*  
*When others would flee, the martial artist stands firm, for action in
the face of a foe was the martial artist's destiny. Because such
readiness requires great speed, the prime requisite of Martial Artists
is DEXterity.*

**Abbreviation:** Mar.

Martial Artists no longer exist in AVATAR.
