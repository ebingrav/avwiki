Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink"): 19w, n, 2w, n, 2w.

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Nom](Nom.md "wikilink").

## Connections

This is by far one of the easiest
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") to access.

## Navigation

This area is a giant rectangle, while small mobs distributed throughout.
At the center is the Tree of Knowledge, which houses the starting
trainer for skills, the new player donation room, and the alternate
Mudschool. It also marks the entrance to the [Cult of
Bonk](:Category:_Cult_Of_Bonk.md "wikilink"). See the map for more
details.

## Adventuring

This [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") is home to a variety of
friendly woodland creatures who you can mercilessly slaughter for newbie
[exp](Experience_Points.md "wikilink"). Aside from the [golden
feather](Golden_Feather.md "wikilink"), there isn't really any
[gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") to speak of, so you might be
better off exploring some of the other
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") surrounding the meadow. If you
are in need of gear, you can head up the tree by starting at
[Nom](Nom "wikilink"), head e, 2u, all n, then d to find yourself in the
newbie cages. The mobs here will give starting equipment, though you can
easily find better in the areas surrounding the Meadow. The gear here is
almost identical to those found in Mudschool. One piece of gear of note
is the [Orb Of Knowledge](Orb_Of_Knowledge "wikilink"), which is useful
while [practicing skills or spells](Practice.md "wikilink").

None of the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") are
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink"), although a fair number may
[assist](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink"), so be careful fighting in
heavily populated [rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink"). All of the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") are of good
[alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink"), so you will quickly become evil
while fighting in the area; for this reason, some newly-created
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") prefer to fight in
either the [The Cult of Bonk](:Category:_Cult_Of_Bonk.md "wikilink") or
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside.md "wikilink") instead.
