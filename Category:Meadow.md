[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Nom](Nom "wikilink").

## Connections

This is by far one of the easiest [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink")
to access.

## Navigation

This area is a giant rectangle, while small mobs distributed throughout.
At the center is the Tree of Knowledge, which houses the starting
trainer for skills, the new player donation room, and the alternate
Mudschool. It also marks the entrance to the [Cult of
Bonk](:Category:_Cult_Of_Bonk "wikilink"). See the map for more details.

## Adventuring

This [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") is home to a variety of
friendly woodland creatures who you can mercilessly slaughter for newbie
[exp](Experience_Points "wikilink"). Aside from the [golden
feather](Golden_Feather "wikilink"), there isn't really any
[gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") to speak of, so you might be better
off exploring some of the other [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink")
surrounding the meadow. If you are in need of gear, you can head up the
tree by starting at [Nom](Nom "wikilink"), head e, 2u, all n, then d to
find yourself in the newbie cages. The mobs here will give starting
equipment, though you can easily find better in the areas surrounding
the Meadow. The gear here is almost identical to those found in
Mudschool. One piece of gear of note is the [Orb Of
Knowledge](Orb_Of_Knowledge "wikilink"), which is useful while
[practicing skills or spells](Practice "wikilink").

None of the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") are
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), although a fair number may
[assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink"), so be careful fighting in heavily
populated [rooms](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"). All of the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") are of good
[alignment](Alignment "wikilink"), so you will quickly become evil while
fighting in the area; for this reason, some newly-created
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") prefer to fight in either
the [The Cult of Bonk](:Category:_Cult_Of_Bonk "wikilink") or
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside "wikilink") instead.
