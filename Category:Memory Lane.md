*"As I suspected, the theoretical tangible recalls of Astral Space do,
in fact, exist. All thoughts and emotions do leave a psionic print that
manifests physically in the Astral Plane. If the emotion is truly
strong, it will linger forever. Over time, these psionic manifestations
of past events have all gathered together in one place (if you can
define a place within the Astral Plane, but that is another thesis) that
I call, 'Memory Lane.'*

*There are dangers there, to be sure, for lurking there are ghostly
shadows of those who have left their mark on history, as I can attest
personally due to my battle with Quixoltan. Luckily, these shadows can
be dispersed with moderate ease, since I obviously could never have
defeated the Feathered Serpent God in reality.*

*There is much to be learned there, but following the true path of
history is difficult. I shall have to research how to follow the true
path when time allows. There is more to this place than meets the eye."*

Nagging notions surround the memory lane path, and most can be found off
the path. If you kill all of the nagging notions, you will encounter
[The Thing that Time Forgot](The_Thing_that_Time_Forgot "wikilink").
This mob hits hard, but drops a top tier ring and a very nice hafted 2H
weapon.
