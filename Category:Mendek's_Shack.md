## Navigation

It is pretty simple. A small area containing sixteen rooms.

## Adventuring

The key to the front door is under the rug. The rug is a container. The
most notable item here is the [Enchanted
Lockpick](Enchanted_Lockpick "wikilink") which is the best/easiest chest
and door lockpick you can get. Just have autoloot on as most of the mobs
are [scavengers](:Category:Scavenging_Mobs.md "wikilink").
