*Built out of the ashes of Before, Mervue is a small coastal city
attempting to forget the past. Situated south of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"), it receives a lot of trade
from both land dwellers and sea folk, helping to boost its unstable
economy. The city's official ruler, per se, is [Lord
Audis](Lord_Audis "wikilink"), who governs from [his
manor](:Category:_Lord_Audis'_Villa "wikilink") just east of the north
entrance to Mervue. Visitors should be warned that the city has put into
place a [justice system](:Category:_Lawful_Areas "wikilink") for those
who try to cause problems, in an attempt to stave more issues like
Before.*

**Level Range:** 23-30

## Connections

## Navigation

## Adventuring

For some backstory on this area, teleport to the storyteller and kill
him for his [notes](notes "wikilink").

There are some very good xp mobs here. However, to avoid an outlaw flag
it's important to know which as some are citizen mobs. The guards who
walk in will steal your kills (or attack you, if you're of low
alignment).

To date I've found the beggars, warlock, thieves, rogues, dockworkers,
crone, jester, fool, mermaid (southeast of the area) to be safe to kill.
Avoid hitting any shopkeepers, the female youth (orphan, I believe), the
tax collector, the banker, etc.
