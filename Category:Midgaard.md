*Ah, Midgaard! The big city! If you can make it there, you can make it
anywhere; truly a city of wonders. Located in the center of our Realm,

[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink") to the west, and the dark
mysteries of [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink") to the east.
What lonely farm boy doesn't dream of one day visiting the [Temple of
Avatar](:Category:_Temple_Of_AVATAR "wikilink"), or catching a glimpse
of the King and his entourage of Guards of the Light? What adventurer
doesn't long to trade tales with [Jake the Thorn
Slayer](Jake_The_Thorn-Slayer "wikilink") in the Dragon's Bane Inn, or
rest up in [Aelmon's
Sanctuary](Aelmon's_Sanctuary_(Midgaard) "wikilink")?*

## Connections

Midgaard lies at Midgaardia's heart; more
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") either visit or pass
through Midgaard every day than any other portion of Midgaardia.

Midgaard connects via one gate in each cardinal direction to
[Midgaardia's extensive highway
system](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"), which, in turn,
provides travelers passage from this big city to various regions,
including [Cathracharraig](:Category:_Cathracharraig "wikilink") at the
foot the northern mountains, [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink")
extending eastward from [the Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"),
[Mervue](:Category:_Mervue "wikilink") on the shores of the [southern
ocean](:Category:_Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes "wikilink"), and various points
westward such as [the Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink"),
[Stonehall](:Category:_Stonehall "wikilink"), and
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink"). See [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") for more information
about these indirect connections.

Midgaard's four corner guard towers also connect upward to the
[Airways](:Category:_Airways "wikilink"), another "highway system" (of
sorts) for those who can (and who prefer to)
[fly](Flying_Flag "wikilink") rather than walk about Midgaardia. See
[the Airways](:Category:_Airways "wikilink") for more information about
where these skyways lead.

In Midgaard's northeastern quadrant, its Warriors' Guild connects to the
subterranean [Hall of Warriors](:Category:_Hall_Of_Warriors "wikilink")
and its secret Rogues' Guild connects northward underground to the
headquarters of [The Outsiders](:Category:_Outsiders "wikilink").

In Midgaard's southeastern quadrant, its park connects with [Midgaard
Fair](:Category:_Midgaard_Fair "wikilink") to its northwest and [The
Museum](:Category:_Museum "wikilink") to its southwest.

In Midgaard's northwestern quadrant are entrances to the city's
prominent [Temple of
Midgaard](:Category:_Temple_Of_Midgaard "wikilink"), side-street
entrance to Midgaardia's underground [Olympic
Grounds](:Category:_Olympic_Grounds "wikilink"), and an alleyway-room
entrance (via a secret locked door) to one of Midgaardia's [Ruined
Lairs](:Category:_Ruined_Lairs "wikilink"). If you can convince the
businessman you can enter into [Pariah's
Paradise](:Category:_Pariah's_Paradise "wikilink").

Also, atop Midgaard Keep is an entrance to [the Hall of
Justice](:Category:_Hall_Of_Justice "wikilink").

## Navigation

Midgaard is big and square. At its heart lies Midgaard Keep and around
its edges lie defensive walls, punctuated by towers, with one gate in
each cardinal direction leading to [a
highway](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"). Between Midgaard's
heart and its edges lie various streets, homes, and shops, as well as
entrances to various other [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") (see
Connections above).

Midgaard Keep is also square and it has four floors. On its first (and
ground) floor is its Main Hall, at the center of which lies [Aelmon's
Sanctuary](Aelmon's_Sanctuary "wikilink")â€”a
[safe](Safe_Rooms "wikilink")
[infirmary](:Category:_Infirmaries "wikilink")
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") where [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink")
the [Healer](:Category:_Healers "wikilink") stands; this
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") serves as a default
[recall](Recall "wikilink") point for all
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") between
[levels](Level "wikilink") 15 and 51. This hall connects via gates in
each direction to each one of Midgaard's four main city streets (see
next paragraph). [Hidden doors](Hidden_Doors "wikilink") on both sides
of each of these four gates connect to interior hallways that lead to
one of four tower stairwells located in each Keep corner. These
stairwells lead up to Midgaard Keep's second and third floors. Midgaard
Keep's second floor contains a throne room with a large antechamber;
various nobles and castle staff [wander](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink")
about these rooms. Midgaard Keep's third floor contains halls and
several bedrooms where more staff [wander](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink");
one of these bedrooms even houses [a priest trainer](Paean "wikilink").
At the south-center of this third floor is a narrow stairway that leads
upward to Midgaard Keep's fourth floor, where brave and daring
[hero-tier](:Category:_Hero "wikilink")
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may enter the [Hall of
Justice](:Category:_Hall_Of_Justice "wikilink").

From each of Midgaard Keep's four gates, a major road extends outward
through the city, and each of these four roads leads to a different
courtyard just inside Midgaard's city walls: Ofcol Boulevard northward
to the Northern Courtyard, Soldiers' Way eastward to the Eastern
Courtyard, Mervue Street southward to the Southern Courtyard (and
Midgaard's [Executioner's Block](Executioner's_Block_Rooms "wikilink")),
and Solace Lane westward to the Western Courtyard. Heroes' Circle
encircles Midgaard Keep, connecting these four roads. Along these four
main thoroughfares lie Midgaard's most important places of business.
Northward, along Ofcol Boulevard, lies [Midgaard's
bank](Bank "wikilink"); [a jeweler](Jeweller "wikilink"), [a
grocer](Grocer "wikilink"), [an alchemist](Alchemist "wikilink"), [an
herbalist](Herbalist "wikilink"), and [a baker](Baker "wikilink") also
operate their shops along this boulevard. Eastward, along Soldier's Way,
[an armorer](Armourer "wikilink") and [a
weaponsmith](Weaponsmith "wikilink") have shops, as well as [a leather
worker](Leather_Worker "wikilink") and [a map
vendor](Chuckie "wikilink"); there is [a pet shop](Petshop "wikilink")
here, as well, and an inn called The Dragon's Bane, whose owner, [Jake
the Thorn-Slayer](Jake_The_Thorn-Slayer "wikilink"), likes to
[reward](:Category:_Ticket_Quest_Rewards "wikilink") fellow
[dragon](Dragons "wikilink")-slayers. One may find [a berzerker
trainer](Hairy_Barbarian "wikilink") among his customers. Southward,
along Mervue Street, [a bow-maker](Bow-Maker "wikilink") sells various
low-[level](Object_Level "wikilink") archery
[items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"). And, westward, along Solace
Lane, [Thrul](Thrul,_The_Wizard "wikilink") buys and sells certain
magical goods like [scrolls](:Category:_Scrolls "wikilink"). Also,
alongside southern Heroes' Circle, [Andromeda](Andromeda "wikilink")
sells some [magical objects](:Category:_Spellcasting_Gear "wikilink"),
too, and [Catalyst](Catalyst "wikilink") operates a brewery.

From each courtyard, a gate extends through Midgaard's city walls to [a
highway](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") beyond. Side streets
circumscribe Midgaard both inside and alongside these city walls and
connect its four courtyards. Here and there along these side streets,
doors open outward into guard towers where stairs lead upward to "wall
walks" that extend along the top of Midgaard's defensive walls. Various
guards [patrol](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink") these walls and towers and,
in the southwest tower, [an assasin trainer](Hitman "wikilink")
[stands](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink"). Along these side streets but
opposite Midgaard's walls are several other places of interest. In
Midgaard's northwest corner lies its Warrior's Guild, where
[warriors](:Category:_Warriors "wikilink") may find [their
guildmaster](Guildmaster_(warrior) "wikilink"). A bit north of the
Eastern Courtyard lies a bar called H.F.I.L. where both [a paladin
trainer](Old_Paladin "wikilink") and [a ranger
trainer](Ex-Wayfinder "wikilink") may be found. Along the southwestern
side street are mainly empty houses, though one contains [a sorcerer
trainer](Master_Of_Pain "wikilink"). Along the northwestern side street,
among more empty houses are a bar called the Golden Lion where [a
bartender](Bartender "wikilink") sells
[drinks](:Category:_Drink_Containers "wikilink"), and Ganymede's Gallery
of Cookies and Curiosities, where
[Amalthea](Amalthea_The_Armorer "wikilink"), [Comet](Comet "wikilink"),
and [Callisto](Callisto "wikilink") each sell their respective wares.

Midgaard may be divided into four quadrants separated by its four main
cross streets. Northwestern Midgaard is dominated by the large [Temple
of Midgaard](:Category:_Temple_Of_Midgaard "wikilink"), home to [a
cleric guildmaster](Guildmaster_(cleric) "wikilink"), which may be
entered both from Solace Lane and from a side street a bit north of
Midgaard's Western Courtyard. An alley extends alongside [this
temple](:Category:_Temple_Of_Midgaard "wikilink")'s northern edge
between this same side street and Midgaard's Northern Courtyard. A
second alley meanders from this Northern Courtyard through northeastern
Midgaard; in this northeastern alley,
[rogues](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") who know [rogue
lore](Rogue_Lore "wikilink") may find their Guild (and, thus, [their
guildmaster](Guildmaster_(rogue) "wikilink")).
[Archers](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") may find [their
guildmaster](Lord_Of_The_Hunt "wikilink") atop a tree at the northern
edge of The Park, which dominates Midgaard's southwestern quadrant and
which may be entered both from Mervue Street opposite The Fletchery and
from a side street a little south of Midgaard's Eastern Courtyard. Both
Citizen's Way/Lane/Row and a third alley snake about from Midgaard's
Southern Courtyard through its southwestern quadrant, where they pass
both various homes and a dump; within this residential section, more
[hidden doors](Hidden_Doors "wikilink") lead to two more guildmasters,
[one for mages](Guildmaster_(mage) "wikilink") and [one for
psionicists](Guildmistress "wikilink").

See [Midgaard Map](Midgaard_Map "wikilink") for more detail.

Because Midgaard is a ["lawful
city"](:Category:_Lawful_Areas "wikilink") filled with
[wandering](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink")
[citizen](Citizen_Mobs "wikilink") and
[townguard](Townguard_Mobs "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"), any
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") who start fights within
most parts of it risk becoming [outlawed](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink") (see
[Lawful Areas](:Category:_Lawful_Areas "wikilink") for more information
on this subject). Those who [practice](Practice "wikilink") [rogue
lore](Rogue_Lore "wikilink") will be able to see which
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") to avoid fighting around (namely,
those showing [lawful flags](Lawful_Flag "wikilink")) and so, if they
are careful, then they may be able to fight most anywhere in Migaard
without ever becoming [outlawed](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink"). Also, any
[outlawed](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink")
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") who are jailed and who
use their [awareness](Awareness_(command/skill) "wikilink")
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") (if they've
[practiced](Practice "wikilink") it) may see a way to spring themselves
from jail, although this will not remove their [outlaw
flag](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink").

One part of Midgaard where
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may fight freely without
risking becoming [outlawed](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink") is in The Park in
its southeastern quadrant. Here, various ducks, swans, and sparrows (all
[level](Level "wikilink") 15 with heroic
[alignment](Alignment "wikilink")) [wander](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink")
about with nary a [citizen](Citizen_Mobs "wikilink") nor
[townguard](Townguard_Mobs "wikilink") in sight.

## Notes

The city of Midgaard was revised in 2014. Various staples of the area
were removed or rewritten, for reasons that are still to be determined.
One notable example was the elimination of the mage and psionicist
guilds and their replacement by inaccessible nondescript buildings with
no entrances. Adjacent houses were also sealed shut. But the most
significant and visible change was the elimination of the various
townguards that had long patrolled the city streets. Death Guards,
Guards of the Light (both lvl 50), wandering guards (late 30s), sentinel
guards near Aelmon and the entrances to Midgaard and the powerful Elite
Midgaard Townguards (lvl 118) have all been phased out. Solely the
executioner, the jailer (and his more recently-created assistant) have
survived the purges. Shopkeepers, too, have been rewritten as have their
rooms, though their levels and functions remain intact.
