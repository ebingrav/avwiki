*Set on a gently rolling plain to the north-east of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"), several farms were
established at the behest of the King, in order to better feed the
masses living within [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink"). The
King granted land to four petitioners: two [humans](Humans "wikilink"),
simple minded but hard working; a [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink")
shepard, for his obvious talents; and an old [gnome](Gnomes "wikilink"),
as a favor to of the [Gnomish](Gnomes "wikilink") government. These
farms continue to nourish the kingdom today. This region also contains
[an old military post](:Category:_Frontier_Outpost "wikilink"), [Lake
Triumph](:Category:_Lake_Triumph "wikilink") and [an ancient
Vineyard](:Category:_LeMans_Vineyard "wikilink"). It is also rumored
that a gang of [thieves](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") operates out of
[a hidden base](:Category:_Outsiders "wikilink") in the area.*
