*Set on a gently rolling plain to the north-east of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink"), several farms were
established at the behest of the King, in order to better feed the
masses living within [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink"). The
King granted land to four petitioners: two
[humans](Humans.md "wikilink"), simple minded but hard working; a
[centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink") shepard, for his obvious talents; and
an old [gnome](Gnomes.md "wikilink"), as a favor to of the
[Gnomish](Gnomes.md "wikilink") government. These farms continue to
nourish the kingdom today. This region also contains [an old military
post](:Category:_Frontier_Outpost.md "wikilink"), [Lake
Triumph](:Category:_Lake_Triumph.md "wikilink") and [an ancient
Vineyard](:Category:_LeMans_Vineyard.md "wikilink"). It is also rumored
that a gang of [thieves](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") operates out
of [a hidden base](:Category:_Outsiders.md "wikilink") in the area.*
