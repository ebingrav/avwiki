*The realm of Midgaardia is a vast plane populated by countless species
and settlements. While in times past the plane was often subject to
terrible invasions from otherworldly beings, today a mostly peaceful
atmosphere pervades Midgaardia. When wars happen, they affect only a few
societies; no devastation can approach the colossal struggles which the
old stories recount. Assorted rumors and legends credit this relative
tranquility to the protection of a Lady Astra and to the efforts of the
Lords and Ladies who have attained power like hers, but there is no
guarantee that the dark times of the plane are forever banished.*
