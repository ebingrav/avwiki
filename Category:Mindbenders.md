*Mindbenders are those
[Psionicists](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") who shun
[telekinesis](:Category:_Telekinetic_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") as
an impure application of the Science, and focus instead on
[telepathic](:Category:_Telepathic_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink")
magic. This focus on the purity of mind-on-mind domination makes
Mindbender spells much harder to resist, and their attack spells more
damaging.*

*Like all [Prestige Classes](:Category:_Prestige_Classes.md "wikilink"),
they retain the original class's [Prime
Requisite](Prime_Requisite.md "wikilink"), in this case,
[Intelligence](Intelligence.md "wikilink"). As a Psionic class, they
possess a Psion's higher degree of success with spells such as
[deception](Deception.md "wikilink"). Mindbenders are prone to the type
of arrogance that can lead a caster down darker paths. They can become
[Sorcerors](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink") earlier than
[Psions](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") can.*

*Mindbender masters are known to seek solitude and quiet.*

## Mindbenders in General

As with [psions](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink"),
[Scramble](Scramble.md "wikilink") (for mobs that cast) and
[Deception](Deception.md "wikilink") (for mobs that wield) are very
useful in combat. Also, [Psyphon](Psyphon.md "wikilink") can be nice if
a mob has mana/spell casting, although it's not available until hero
250. The int debuff from [Rupture](Rupture.md "wikilink") in direct
combat can be cleared by having a
[priest](:Category:_Priests.md "wikilink") cast
[clarify](Clarify.md "wikilink") on you. As compared to their closest
rivals sor and wzd they don't have the handicaps of missing certain
useful spells, such as sneak & fortitudes for wzd and awen and sanctuary
for sor. The strength of [Hive Mind](Hive_Mind "wikilink") is affected
by the casters racial psionic bonus (psionic spell cost reduction).

## Mindbender Creation

Requirements:

-   level 50 Psion
-   Psionically gifted race
-   No ties to a faith
-   A young mind

The following races can become mindbenders: Due, Dwf, Liz, Trg, Drg,
Gth, Har, HiE, Hob, Drc, Tua, DtI.

Miraars may become mindbenders by copying one of the above races to
prestige. Additional race options are available by making a mindbender
of one of the above races and then remorting.

Note that the "young mind" requirement refers to the age of your
character in hours played, not by creation date. The exact cutoff for
prestige is unknown but assumed to be around the number of hours
required to advance your character's age from 17 to 18 (roughly 1,350
hours). While this is rarely a concern for newly-created characters,
players who wish to remort first (e.g. into HiE, Tua or Gth) before they
prestige may want to minimize the amount of time spent with their
character logged in and not running to avoid missing the cutoff.

## Mindbenders at Hero Tier

### Training

### Practicing

### Devoting

Mindbenders do not worship. Worship is for the weak. Devoting does not
apply.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Mindbenders have difficulty soloing in comparison to Mages
and other spell casting classes. Even though they can surge as high as
5, they rely on [ultrablast](ultrablast "wikilink") as their main damage
spell up until Hero 101. When Mindbenders receive the spell
[rupture](rupture "wikilink"), it does as much damage as
[disintegrate](disintegrate "wikilink"), but unfortunately the spell
gives a temporary -[INT](Intelligence.md "wikilink") debuff if you use
it while in melee with a mob. Because of this, Mindbenders run the risk
of getting reduced mana gains on leveling up if they do not pay
attention to this INT debuff.

**Tanking:** Mindbenders tank as well as any other mage, through where
they lack in damage (and being able to cast [charge
shield](Charge_Shield.md "wikilink")) they make up for in utility.
[Deception](Deception "wikilink"),
[overconfidence](Overconfidence.md "wikilink"),
[dread](dread "wikilink"), [illusory
shield](Illusory_Shield.md "wikilink"), [panic](panic "wikilink") and
even [anger management](Anger_Management.md "wikilink") make for some
interesting and fun Hero runs.

**Hitting:** They are less effective than most damage-casting classes as
hitters. They do not have [chaos channel](Chaos_Channel.md "wikilink")
like other spell casters, and since they lack the efficient and
effective kinetic spells of a Psionicist, they effectively hit like a
mage with a spell that costs twice as much mana (although with the right
mobs [psyphon](psyphon "wikilink") can mitigate this). Again, the
utility of being able to use [deception](deception "wikilink"),
[scramble](scramble "wikilink") and other psionic debuffs are the
class's only usefulness.

**Healing:** Other then brandishing healing items, Mindbenders typically
do not heal.

## Mindbenders at Lord Tier

Mindbenders are effective damage dealers at lord. Their main damage
spell, [fracture](Fracture.md "wikilink"), does about the same base
damage as [brimstone](Brimstone.md "wikilink") does for
[sorcerers](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink") (though without the
benefit of [worship](Worship.md "wikilink") or
[immolation](Immolation.md "wikilink") the actual output is much less).
With [psyphon](psyphon "wikilink"), they have the ability to surge
higher in areas with spellcasting mobs. They also have more hp than
[wizards](:Category:_Wizards.md "wikilink") and
[sorcerers](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink"), and they get [illusory
shield](Illusory_Shield.md "wikilink") which helps with survivability.
In addition, they are more successful than
[psionicists](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") with their
telepathic spells like [scramble](scramble "wikilink") and
[deception](deception "wikilink").

Similar to sorcerers, you should be targeting your damage spell at all
times, even when mages and wizards are area spelling. Don't bother
scrambling mobs unless they cast spells, and use psyphon only against
the same mobs. Deception is a waste of time unless mobs with weapons are
really punishing the tank.

If you're thinking of casting cataclysm, just don't. The number of
targets you need to hit with this out-of-class spell to do equivalent
damage to fracture is far too large to make it practical in any
circumstance.

## Mindbender Remort Options

[Remort Classes](:Category:_Remort_Classes.md "wikilink")

-   [Sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink"): At Lord level 100, a
    Mindbender can remort into a [human](human "wikilink")
    [sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink"). If they would like
    to keep their current race, they would have to remort at Lord level
    200 instead.
