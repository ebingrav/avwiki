*The Factory sits at the end of a short path south of
[Nom](Nom "wikilink")'s [Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink") and is
responsible for the manufacture of all kinds of monsters and creepy
crawlies. Lately though, it has been rumored to experience technical
difficulties.*

## Directions

Walking route from [Nom](Nom "wikilink"): 3w, 7s, 2e.

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Floyd](Fix-It_Floyd "wikilink").

## Connections

The Factory is of course connected to [ the
Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink"), but also has a couple of
connections to the [Murky Lair](:Category:_Murky_Lair "wikilink"), a
sewer of sorts where there are slimes who carry [slimy
rings](Slimy_Ring "wikilink"). Look for a down exit in the **Worker's
Utilities**, just off of the **Mob Factory Kitchen**, or alternatively
the easternmost room on the **Primary Assembly Line**.

## Navigation

This area is fairly uniform; mobs that are good for exp can be found
throughout. Not much danger in this area, so it is safe to wander about.

## Adventuring

Another favourite of [newbie
areas](:Category:_Lowmort_1-10_Areas "wikilink"), the Mob Factory is a
good place for [characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") a bit more
brutish (or real low level grouped chars) to run, as the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") here seem to do a bit more damage
than in other [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"). It has a high
concentration of [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") that give good
[exp](Experience_Points "wikilink").

All [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") will
[assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink") (except for
[Floyd](Fix-It_Floyd "wikilink")), and most
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") (with the exception of the severed
heads) will [flee](Flee "wikilink") easily. Everything is of about equal
difficulty, and the only [mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") not worth
fighting is [Floyd](Fix-It_Floyd "wikilink") himself because of his
sanctuary.
