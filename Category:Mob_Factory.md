*The Factory sits at the end of a short path south of
[Nom](Nom.md "wikilink")'s [Meadow](:Category:_Meadow.md "wikilink") and
is responsible for the manufacture of all kinds of monsters and creepy
crawlies. Lately though, it has been rumored to experience technical
difficulties.*

**Level Range:** 3-6

**Builder:** Revised

## Directions

Walking route from [Nom](Nom.md "wikilink"): 3w, 7s, 2e.

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Floyd](Fix-It_Floyd.md "wikilink").

## Connections

The Factory is of course connected to [ the
Meadow](:Category:_Meadow.md "wikilink"), but also has a couple of
connections to the [Murky Lair](:Category:_Murky_Lair.md "wikilink"), a
sewer of sorts where there are slimes who carry [slimy
rings](Slimy_Ring.md "wikilink"). Look for a down exit in the **Worker's
Utilities**, just off of the **Mob Factory Kitchen**, or alternatively
the easternmost room on the **Primary Assembly Line**.

## Navigation

This area is fairly uniform; mobs that are good for exp can be found
throughout. Not much danger in this area, so it is safe to wander about.

## Adventuring

Another favourite of [newbie
areas](:Category:_Lowmort_1-10_Areas.md "wikilink"), the Mob Factory is
a good place for [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") a bit
more brutish (or real low level grouped chars) to run, as the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") here seem to do a bit more damage
than in other [areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"). It has a high
concentration of [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") that give good
[exp](Experience_Points.md "wikilink").

All [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") will
[assist](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink") (except for
[Floyd](Fix-It_Floyd.md "wikilink")), and most
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") (with the exception of the severed
heads) will [flee](Flee.md "wikilink") easily. Everything is of about
equal difficulty, and the only [mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") not
worth fighting is [Floyd](Fix-It_Floyd.md "wikilink") himself because of
his sanctuary.
