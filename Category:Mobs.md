*A mob, short for mobile, is any computer-run character (the things you
kill). This is similar to the distinction between [player
character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") (PC, what your player-run
character is) and non-player character (NPC, a computer-run mob). Mobs
can be squirrels, [humans](Humans "wikilink"), or
[dragons](Dragons "wikilink"). Some will attack you, some can
[train](:Category:_Trainers "wikilink") you, others will [sell
things](:Category:_Shopkeepers "wikilink") to you.*
