*A mob, short for mobile, is any computer-run character (the things you
kill). This is similar to the distinction between [player
character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") (PC, what your
player-run character is) and non-player character (NPC, a computer-run
mob). Mobs can be squirrels, [humans](Humans.md "wikilink"), or
[dragons](Dragons.md "wikilink"). Some will attack you, some can
[train](:Category:_Trainers.md "wikilink") you, others will [sell
things](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink") to you.*
