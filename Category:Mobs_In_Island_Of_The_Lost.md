The island begins with shipwrecked sailors, non aggro and ez kills for
low xp. then the fountain take you to Soldiers and a Centurion, circa
roman empre, aggies and assisters tougher mobs. after the soldiers u
either get painted plains warriors or knights templar both moderately
tuff. next comes either amazons or cave trolls both very tuff and then
you come to the samurai level. this is the last one and the mobs are
VERY lethal. Longshot does not work in the first room only so move very
carefully. scan as you move and kill the guardians of the fountain and
on one of them you will find the letter.
