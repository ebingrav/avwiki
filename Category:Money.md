These [objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") are a bit different
than other [objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") because, when
[gotten](Get.md "wikilink") from the ground or from a
[mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink")'s corpse or whatnot, they disappear
and become part of one's [Gold in Hand](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink").
They are somtimes found together with
[Gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones.md "wikilink").
