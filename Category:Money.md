other [objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") because, when
[gotten](Get "wikilink") from the ground or from a
[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink")'s corpse or whatnot, they disappear
and become part of one's [Gold in Hand](Gold_In_Hand "wikilink"). They
are somtimes found together with
[Gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones "wikilink").
