*There is a dense, wild forest nestled between two hills running from
the Dwarven trade route to the mountains. This is Morgan Vale. Once it
was planned to build a road through the Vale, but any surveyors who
began this deed never finished it. Rumors abound there of dryads and
nymphs, protecting the forest.*
