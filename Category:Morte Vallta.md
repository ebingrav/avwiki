*Morte Vallta, a terrible place of dark magicks and foul beasts, has
long been whispered of in the boasts of braggarts in the smoky taverns
across Midgaardia. Said to have been the home of Azric the Undying, a
powerful sorcerer, he shaped the valley for his own evil ends throughout
the centuries of his life. For his enjoyment he created his Arena of
Sport where creatures from this and other worlds did battle to the death
as he cheered them on. Some rumors say that Azric the man no longer
lives, having been replaced with [something
else](Power_Liche_Azric "wikilink") after his magicks went too far into
the darkness. Recent boasts overheard by
[Jake](Jake_The_Thorn-Slayer "wikilink") at the Dragon's Bane say that
the valley has gone wild with creatures brought there long ago by Azric
himself returning to a feral state of kill or be killed as they struggle
for dominance. One madman was overheard raving of [a creature made from
the very stone walls of the valley itself](Collosus "wikilink"), trying
to bring the valley under the control of him and his ilk. But again,
amongst barroom boasts, what can be trusted?*

## Navigation

Head down from giant vulture. Navigation is mostly scan/kill. All the
rooms are cursed, 6 rooms are anti-magic as well.

## Adventuring

Mostly scan/kill. Area has a high mob density and fairly large range of
mob levels. Can be very swarmy. Many of the mobs wield, a few cast
spells, and a lot of them are aggressive. There are also six no-spell
rooms, spread at random places. The non-aggie mobs are gargoyles, orcs,
ogres, griffons, basilisks, harpies, unicorns, sleeping giant and
duergar. The rest are aggie.

Notable mobs:

-   Tcho-tcho: poisons
-   Djinn: mindbender; dreads and scrambles among other things
-   Iadus/Oborus: Sanced and biggish
-   [Collosus](Collosus "wikilink"): Big, sanced and wields. Has no
    problem getting a hitter for \*MANGLING\* or above.
-   [Azric](Power_Liche_Azric "wikilink"): Big, sanced and casts spells.
    Has protection good, so takes a long time to kill.

This area also connects to one of the [Ruined
Lairs](:Category:Ruined_Lair_3_Of_5 "wikilink") areas. To reach it,
navigate the area to the far western side. The Ruined Lair entrance is
3n from the room called *A Crossing*, which connects to the Collosus'
throne ascent to the west.
