*Daemonstone, the long fabled mystical material. The quest for it has
taken Alastar to all reaches of the known realm, searching throughout
the planes for any that know of it. This unholy quest long ago robbed
him of his sanity. He has most recently brought his madness to the World
of Stone, where his forces strive to shape the elements. He has hired
mercenaries from distant planes, with which he hopes to depose the
Elemental Lord and be the sole possessor of Earthrealm's elemental
bounty. It is rumored that one piece of Daemonstone has been
created...but who really trusts rumor?.*
