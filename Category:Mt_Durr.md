*Long ago, two rival mountain Gods stood at opposite ends of a range.
One was tall, but jagged, twisted and ruinous, known as Abishai (today
called Devil's Peak). The other, [Durr](Durr "wikilink"), was shorter,
but stocky, proud and strong. Ancient Legend speaks of a rivalry between
them that led to war between their children; the
[Dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") of Durr and the mountain
[trolls](Trolls "wikilink") of Abishai. The [Elves](Elves "wikilink") of
the time paid homage to the [mountain god](Durr "wikilink") as a patron
of craftsmen and tinkerers, and if not for that, he would have been
forgotten, as [Dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") are a practical race, with
little time for myth. Although the Mountain is still called
[Durr](Durr "wikilink"), few Dwarves remember the [mountain
god](Durr "wikilink") that created them. The teachings of
[Kra](Kra "wikilink") are the only religion most
[Dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") follow now.*

## Connections

Mt Durr is most commonly approached from the [Dwarven Trade
Route](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") from the south, though
if you are coming from [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") you
may find it quicker to approach via the
[Airways](:Category:_Airways "wikilink") route, which will take you
directly to middle of the city. It is also possible to enter into the
eastern region of the city through the [Underway
Tunnels](:Category:_Underway_Tunnels "wikilink"), though this is not a
particularly obvious or useful exit. Mt Durr is one of the most popular
ways to access the [Duergar
Stronghold](:Category:_Duergar_Stronghold "wikilink") and the areas
which lie beyond it and this connection can be found through a hidden
trapdoor in [Borgin](Retired_Patriarch_Borgin "wikilink")'s house, in
the eastern region of the city. Finally, both the [Dwarven
Catacombs](:Category:_Dwarven_Catacombs "wikilink") and the [Great
Divide](:Category:_Great_Divide "wikilink") can be reached from the
city, respectively through the temple of [Kra](Kra "wikilink") and from
within the mountain which gives the area its name. A [Fortress Of
Kra](:Category:Fortress_Of_Kra "wikilink") can be reached as well.

## Navigation

Mt Durr is a large area and it can be divided up into several sections.

-   The lower city is cloest to the [Dwarven Trade
    Route](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") and often has
    multiple mobs in the same rooms and is not particularly interesting.
    Visitors are advised to turn **west** when entering the city to
    avoid one of the few easily accessed [aggie
    mobs](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") and to make their way to the main
    city.
-   The main city stretches from the mountain in the west to rough of
    town in the east and up to the northern road and the temple of
    [Kra](Kra "wikilink") in the north east. A lot of wandering mobs can
    be found in this part of the city, as well useful locations like the
    tavern and the mining guild.
-   The eastern section of the city is very small and a lot quieter than
    the main part. It is reached either by travelling just past the
    temple of [Kra](Kra "wikilink") or taking the hidden route through
    the animal pen in the rough end of town. This is where
    [Borgin](Retired_Patriarch_Borgin "wikilink") lives and it connects
    to both the [Underway
    Tunnels](:Category:_Underway_Tunnels "wikilink") and the [Duergar
    Stronghold](:Category:_Duergar_Stronghold "wikilink").
-   The temple of [Kra](Kra "wikilink") holds several mobs which will
    not wander far from this area, a connection to the [Dwarven
    Catacombs](:Category:_Dwarven_Catacombs "wikilink") and perhaps
    something more...
-   The mountain is a [no-recall](Cursed_Rooms "wikilink") area for the
    most part and contains both [wandering
    mobs](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink") and
    [sentinels](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink"). Be careful of the
    [aggies](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") behind Durr's left eye and
    straying beyond them will take you to the [Great
    Divide](:Category:_Great_Divide "wikilink") - definitely not
    something you want to do unless you are a
    [hero](:Category:_Hero "wikilink") or above, probably.
-   Also inside the mountain, but in a seperate direction you will find
    the mines. The mines require various keys to access their levels,
    but delving into them is well worth it in terms of equipment,
    experience and fun. There are some
    [aggies](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") down here, but they stay put
    and are all in the less populated parts of these mines and easily
    avoided. Some of level one has been flooded and is underwater, so
    bring a [boat](:Category:_Boats "wikilink"), be
    [flying](Flying_Flag "wikilink") or have the appropriate spells on
    if you wish to explore this less travelled part. Much of the mines
    are [no recall](Cursed_Rooms "wikilink") - but by no means all - and
    the [doors](:Category:_Doors "wikilink") are locked and [cannot be
    passdoored](Passproof_Doors "wikilink").

## Adventuring

There are many secrets waiting to be uncovered. Maybe you can find great
wealth, old relics, new potions and bring home a trophy of a great
beast.

Have fun exploring the temple of [Kra](Kra "wikilink"), the town and the
depths of the mines. There are many [ticket
quests](:Category:_Quests_In_Mt_Durr "wikilink"), great
[gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink"), loot, and even a skinnable mob.
