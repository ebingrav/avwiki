*You have heard whispers in the
[meadow](:Category:_Meadow.md "wikilink") of a series of sewer tunnels
that run from beneath the [Dwarven Day
Care](:Category:_Dwarven_Day_Care.md "wikilink") to underneath the [Mob
Factory](:Category:_Mob_Factory.md "wikilink").*

**Level Range:** 4-6

**Builder:** Frey

## Directions

Walking route from [Nom](Nom.md "wikilink"): s, 7e, 3s, e, \[d\].

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [water
spider](Water_Spider.md "wikilink").

## Connections

This sewer of sorts can be accessed from two places in the [Mob
Factory](:Category:_Mob_Factory.md "wikilink") and one in the [Dwarven
Day Care](:Category:_Dwarven_Day_Care.md "wikilink").

## Navigation

The west end of the area connects to the [Mob
Factory](:Category:_Mob_Factory.md "wikilink"), while the east end of
the area connects to the [Dwarven Day
Care](:Category:_Dwarven_Day_Care.md "wikilink"). At the center of the
area is a large square where the [Green Slimes](Green_Slime "wikilink")
tend to congregate. At the center of the square sits the [Giant
Alligator](Giant_Alligator_(Murky_Lair).md "wikilink"), an
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink") and formidable mob. See the
map and the Adventuring section for more details.

## Adventuring

There are slimes who carry [slimy rings](Slimy_Ring.md "wikilink"),
which give the same bonuses as the [pink ice
rings](Pink_Ice_Ring_(Dwarven_Daycare).md "wikilink"). Take care
crossing through the passage, as most
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") will
[assist](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink"), and there is a nasty
[aggy](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink") alligator which is
[hidden](Hide_Flag.md "wikilink") in the middle of the path (Room desc:
Alligator's lair; you may also see one pair of "red glowing eyes" on
[scan](Scan.md "wikilink")). You can manoeuvre safely around him,
however, if you are careful.

Other than the Giant Alligator, most of the mobs are fairly small and
good for exp. There's also a good number of them, though some of them
have a poisonous [bite](Biting_Mobs.md "wikilink"). A pretty good area
for exp.
