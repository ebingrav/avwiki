*East of the [Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink"), just a bit up the
hill, a small path leads into a cave. Mushrooms grow there, large and
small, disgusting and colourful. For a long time the
[goblins](Goblins "wikilink") who inhabit these caverns have collected
the mushrooms as a basic food supply, while raiding the hills and the
land beyond every now and then. But for some time now the raids have
stopped. All that can be heard from the cave are the surprising sounds
of singing, drunken fights, or loud, delicious snoring. Drink! That is
what the focus of the small enclave has turned to - ever since the
[shaman](Goblin_Shaman "wikilink") found out how to distill something
other than venomous stinking brews.*

## Adventuring

From Nom, head s, 7e, u. Recall set here as it is a safe
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") (marked by the distinctive 'Goblin
Terry Torry' sign). It's actually outside the Mushroom Caves area, which
means nothing will GLARE at you and SNARL after you
[flee](Flee "wikilink"). Remember to [quit](Quit "wikilink") and log
back in if you [flee](Flee "wikilink") and [recall](Recall "wikilink");
this makes anything you fled from forget you, and stops them from
tracking you down again when you re-enter the area.

2e from the safe [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") there will be the
guard post containing two [stationary](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"); usually a sleeping goblin on top and
a drunk goblin underneath (maybe a
[wanderer](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink"), including crazed goblins). K dru
first so as to avoid [assists](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink").

From here, e, 4n takes you to a [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink")
called 'The goblin camp', which usually has 5
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in it - only the top two are awake.
This is another good [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"), since the
[wandering](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink") crazed goblins don't enter it. No
[aggies](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") = safe place to
[sleep](Sleep_(command) "wikilink"). (Really nice place to
[sleep](Sleep_(command) "wikilink") if you are a
[NOSUN](Racial_Nosun "wikilink") [race](:Category:_Races "wikilink"),
since it's [indoors](Indoor_Rooms "wikilink"), unlike the
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") with the 'Terry Torry' sign outside
the [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink")). From here, n, w, n takes you
to the pair of fanatical guards... but more of them later.

There is normally a crazed goblin north of the goblin camp, but they do
[wander](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink"). The
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") north of the goblin camp seems to
only have exits west and south, but there is a hidden
[door](:Category:_Doors "wikilink") to the east that leads to a
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") with the [goblin
shaman](Goblin_Shaman "wikilink") in it (another portal point). The
[shaman](Goblin_Shaman "wikilink") is worth some good
[exp](Experience_Points "wikilink") but casts
[blindness](Blindness "wikilink") and [faerie
fire](Faerie_Fire "wikilink") as well as healing itself, so I usually
don't bother. Oh, and don't loot the corpse, since it carries cursed
stuff that is really not worth it.

Other sections of note:

From the camp, 2s takes you back to a mushroom cave where there are
normally around 3 mushroom collectors (and miscellaneous [wandering
mobs](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink")) that [flee](Wimpy_Mobs "wikilink").
ene to the toadstool monster (which is
[stationary](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink") and seen on
[scan](Scan "wikilink") as A large and strange creature is munching on
the mushrooms), a rather difficult [mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") as
he has armor and poisions - don't bother.

From the guard post go n, 2w to get to another mushroom cave. I've seen
up to 6 mushroom carriers here, [fleers](Wimpy_Mobs "wikilink") again.
From here, w, 2n to get to the distillery - another
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") the crazed goblins don't wander
into. Usually holds 4 goblins plus the odd keg or mushroom carrying
goblin.

From the distillery, e, s, e takes you to the mushroom patch that is 2s
from the camp. E, n, e, 2n from the distillery takes you to the pair of
fanatical guards outside the throne room door. Be wary of fighting in
the [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") south of them... if you
[flee](Flee "wikilink") into their [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink")
you will probably die, and dying in a
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") where 2 [aggie
mobs](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") repop is no fun for a low
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink").

Finally, north of the 2 [aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")
fanatical guards through a closed but unlocked
[door](:Category:_Doors "wikilink") is the throne room, usually
containing the king, a servant and two guards
([aggie](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")). The king will
[assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink") as well, so I normally don't bother
with this [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") until about
[level](Level "wikilink") 8 or maybe 9. Important to remember that repop
will close the [door](:Category:_Doors "wikilink") - if you think you
may have to [flee](Flee "wikilink"), look every round of combat or so to
see if the [door](:Category:_Doors "wikilink") is closed. In fact, since
repop will replace the [aggie](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") guards
outside, trying to [recall](Recall "wikilink") from combat is definitely
a good option.

All the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in this area are evil, so
it's a good [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") to return to good
[alignment](Alignment "wikilink") if needed.
