*Mystic Arrows consume [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink") to create, and
require natural [fletch kits](Fletching_Tools_And_Materials "wikilink")
which only [Druids](:Category:_Druids "wikilink") can collect using the
[Druid Oath](Druidic_Oath "wikilink") skill and the
[forage](Forage "wikilink") command. The user must have also taken the
[Druid Oath](Druidic_Oath "wikilink") to use these obscure weapons.*

-   [Autumn Arrows](Autumn_Arrows "wikilink"): *The [Autumn
    arrow](Autumn_Arrows "wikilink") explodes in a rain of leaves just
    before impact, potentially blinding enemies. The magic of these
    [arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink") is much harder for enemies to
    resist than a typical [blind](Blindness "wikilink") spell, but
    doesn't work if fired over long distances.*

<!-- -->

-   [Faerie Arrows](Faerie_Arrows "wikilink"): *These
    [arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink") cast the [faerie
    fire](Faerie_Fire "wikilink") spell on their target in addition to
    doing minor damage. The spell, delivered in such a visceral manner,
    is harder for enemies to resist.*

<!-- -->

-   [Green Arrows](Green_Arrows "wikilink"): *Made of green wood and
    fletched with leaves, these [arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink")
    are magically enhanced such that they repair themselves, meaning
    they can never be destroyed by impact. Although they are weak
    against armor, their enchantments make them quite damaging,
    especially to undead.*

<!-- -->

-   [Moonshard Arrows](Moonshard_Arrows "wikilink"): *These
    [arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink"), created by ancient
    [drow](Drow "wikilink"), cast an affect similar to the
    [Sorceror](:Category:_Sorcerers "wikilink") spell
    [unrest](Unrest "wikilink"), in addition to doing damage. The spell,
    delivered in such a visceral manner, is harder for enemies to
    resist.*
