*Mystic Arrows consume [mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink") to create, and
require natural [fletch
kits](Fletching_Tools_And_Materials.md "wikilink") which only
[Druids](:Category:_Druids.md "wikilink") can collect using the [Druid
Oath](Druidic_Oath.md "wikilink") skill and the
[forage](Forage.md "wikilink") command. The user must have also taken
the [Druid Oath](Druidic_Oath.md "wikilink") to use these obscure
weapons.*

-   [Autumn Arrows](Autumn_Arrows.md "wikilink"): *The [Autumn
    arrow](Autumn_Arrows.md "wikilink") explodes in a rain of leaves
    just before impact, potentially blinding enemies. The magic of these
    [arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink") is much harder for enemies
    to resist than a typical [blind](Blindness.md "wikilink") spell, but
    doesn't work if fired over long distances.*

-   [Faerie Arrows](Faerie_Arrows.md "wikilink"): *These
    [arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink") cast the [faerie
    fire](Faerie_Fire.md "wikilink") spell on their target in addition
    to doing minor damage. The spell, delivered in such a visceral
    manner, is harder for enemies to resist.*

<!-- -->

-   [Green Arrows](Green_Arrows.md "wikilink"): *Made of green wood and
    fletched with leaves, these
    [arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink") are magically enhanced
    such that they repair themselves, meaning they can never be
    destroyed by impact. Although they are weak against armor, their
    enchantments make them quite damaging, especially to undead.*

<!-- -->

-   [Moonshard Arrows](Moonshard_Arrows.md "wikilink"): *These
    [arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink"), created by ancient
    [drow](Drow.md "wikilink"), cast an affect similar to the
    [Sorceror](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink") spell
    [unrest](Unrest.md "wikilink"), in addition to doing damage. The
    spell, delivered in such a visceral manner, is harder for enemies to
    resist.*
