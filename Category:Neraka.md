*The demon world of Neraka is the realm of the
[Demon](Demons "wikilink") house of [Belag](Belag "wikilink"). Sent into
exile here after his defeat by the hands of [Kariya](Kariya "wikilink")
and Dyah Yuyun Utami, [Belag](Belag "wikilink") is held captive in the
Pinnacle of Angker. Many of his minions still dwell in this accursed
place, hoping to escape from that dreaded realm and spread chaos through
the multiverse once again.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

**Builder:** Kariya

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 15e, \[s\], 4s, w, n,
\[d\], \[d\].

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Ajal](Ajal "wikilink") (warning:
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")).

## Connections

-   [Temple Of Utami](:Category:Temple_Of_Utami "wikilink")
    ([map](Temple_Of_Utami_Map "wikilink")) - inbound only

## Navigation

The area is rather small. From the starting room (accessible via portal
in [Temple Of Utami](:Category:Temple_Of_Utami "wikilink")) there is a
straight path to a 4x3 set of rooms with the
[Highpriest](Highpriest "wikilink") in the middle. Going down from the
southwestern corner will bring you to yet another mini-set of rooms with
[Ajal](Ajal "wikilink"), and going straight south brings you to the
*Pool of Darkness*. From here, due westwards is the quest path towards
[Belag](Belag "wikilink").

Random rooms are uncursed, so recalling is possible without much effort.

## Adventuring

Scarcely populated and rather small, Neraka is best known for its
[Symbol Of Darkness](Symbol_Of_Darkness "wikilink"), found on the demon
lord [Belag](Belag "wikilink"), who resides behind a classic set of 5
quest doors with 5 key-bearing guardians. The
[Highpriest](Highpriest "wikilink") is involved in the [Red Vial
Quest](Red_Vial_Quest "wikilink"), and can be found in the area center,
generally upwards and then north-east from [Ajal](Ajal "wikilink"), who
is a good portal point.

Otherwise, aside for sight-seeing, there isn't much here.
