''Nirvana... a piece of the Astral Plane forever lost in time. The
Astral Plane was once connected to Midgaardia, albeit by a rather
tenuous thread which wavered constantly. Finally the Fae tore Astral
free, and with it came Nirvana.

''Yet still the link from Nirvana to Astral was fragile at best, for it
too began to fray under the assualt of time. Eventually Nirvana broke
from its prison and drifted for eons, slowly, the land coursing between
space.

''And now it has returned, this pocket of absolute balance and order,
and with it comes Primus, its ageless ruler. But how long it will stay
no one can know.

''NOTE: While all efforts have been made to mimic gear which once
appeared here (not all gear is the same), the gear cannot be truly
classified as "grandfathered", but rather "unique", as it is based off a
present day counterpart rather than the original grandfathered item. If
you can take an item, you will keep it even when the area disappears
back into nothingness.

*This area was changed from a Hero to Lord area by mid 1998, and removed
completely a few years later.*
