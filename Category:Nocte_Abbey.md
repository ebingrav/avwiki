*Shortly after the beginning of time, two factions of
[dragons](Dragons "wikilink") warred, the leaders of these two factions
tumbling through the sky in their struggle. At one point one of these
great [dragons](Dragons "wikilink") was thrown to the earth, striking
with such unimaginable force that time itself was injured. Since that
point, that plot of land lies in interminable twilight, even as days and
years pass around it. Over time, it became a point of religious
significance for many [races](:Category:_Races "wikilink"), housing
various altars for various Empires and kingdoms. Ultimately, an Abbey
was built on this land, aiding wayward adventurers on their way past the
[Great Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"). As time passed
by, however, it became run down and quiet, housing only a small
population. So when locals saw a large amount of questionable activity
at the Abbey, the rumors began to fly all over Midgaardia.*

## Navigation

## Adventuring

The mobs on the outskirts of this [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink")
[assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink") against each other if your
[align](Alignment "wikilink") is good. While this is amusing, it makes
it hard to get [exp](Experience_Points "wikilink"), because they steal
your kills. Once you enter the abbey proper the exp gets much better,
but most of the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") use tail attacks, so
don't count on being able to use midround
[commands](:Category:_Commands "wikilink").
