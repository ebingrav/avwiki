*Noctopia is the Dark side of
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia.md "wikilink"); the utopian realm of the
Dark Fae, and the ultimate manifestation of their power. In its prime,
it was ruled by the [Dark Queen
Zydarielle](Zydarielle,_Queen_Of_Stars.md "wikilink"), and her lover,
the [Grand Duke Malafont](Duke_Malafont.md "wikilink"). His death marked
the beginning of the end of the war between the two Fae factions, and
after the Queen fell at the hands of [Adrial
Skythain](High_King_Adrial.md "wikilink"), the remaining Dark Fae simply
lacked the will to maintain their realm. For like
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia.md "wikilink"), Noctopia is the stuff of
dreams, and with the loss of all save one of the original Dark Fae, the
Domain of Stars utterly ceased to exist.*

*Now rumor speaks of its return. Through unknown magicks it has been
reborn from mere memory, and the Dark Fae alone keep the secret.*

*Outsiders are advised to keep their distance. As much as the Arcadians
hate intruders, the Dark Fae are both xenophobic and spiteful, and not
above taking pleasure in cruelty.*

Noctopia makes [Karnath](:Category:Karnath.md "wikilink") look like the
petting zoo. There still remains many secrets to discover in the land of
night.

[Planeshifting](Planeshift "wikilink") to Noctopia takes you to the
[Shiftwatch Orb](:Category:Shiftwatch_Orb.md "wikilink"). See that
area's entry for suggestions on surviving this process.

There is at least one [Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink") room in [Under
The Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars.md "wikilink"). While this is
certainly no picnic, it seems a bit more survivable to shift to the
anchor instead of the [Shiftwatch
Orb](:Category:Shiftwatch_Orb.md "wikilink") when you have the option.

We've also found a [Backdoor To
Noctopia](Backdoor_To_Noctopia "wikilink"). Like the other two entry
options, this is no walk in the park either.
