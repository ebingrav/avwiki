*North of Ofcol? There's nothing north of
[Ofcol](:Category:_Ofcol "wikilink"). Not anymore, anyway. Used to be
that's where the Borleys lived, a long time ago when
[Ofcol](:Category:_Ofcol "wikilink") was just a little farming village.
They had a few tenant farmers, [a grand
Mansion](:Category:_Borley_Manor "wikilink") and a reputation as the
best musicians in the realm. They're dead now, but I hear [their
place](:Category:_Borley_Manor "wikilink") is haunted. There's [an old
keep](:Category:_Shadow_Keep "wikilink") up there too, even older than
the Borleys'. It was rumored to be haunted long before they came.
Probably still is. Rumor has it a group of [mountain
Ogres](Mountain_Ogre "wikilink") have taken over the old abandoned farms
up there.*

## Navigation

This is a connector area, connecting many other hero level areas. The
area itself is a mostly linear path leading from the bottom near
[Cathracharraig](:Category:Cathracharraig "wikilink") all the way to the
top of Devil's Peak (the mountain the area is climbing), where
[Summoning](:Category:Summoning "wikilink") is located.

No rooms are cursed.

## Adventuring

This area is nice for surge soloing a mage in the early 30s. Although
the ogres are all aggie, as long as you avoid rooms with more than one
of them, don't sleep if an ogre is on scan and don't sleep too long,
you'll be just fine.
