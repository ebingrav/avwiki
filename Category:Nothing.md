*Somewhere in the flux between the Elemental Planes is a vast stretch of
empty space. The void has many strange and unusual properties that leak
out to planes of substance.*

*In the vast stretches of this plane, there exists a cult of nihilist
fanatics whose existence lies in the destruction of everything which
isn't nothing.*

**Builder:** Pliny

## Directions

To find the entrance to the Nowhere plane, shift to any elemental plane
and find the Lloydable room.  
\* From [Airscape](:Category:Airscape "wikilink") it's 3e

-   From [Water](:Category:Water "wikilink") is 2n e u
-   From [World Of Stone](:Category:World_Of_Stone "wikilink") is n 4w.
-   From [Fire Realm](:Category:Firerealm_Proper "wikilink") is 2n, e.

Enter the nexus there and you will be in Nothing.

## Connections

Connects to each elemental plane, but once you enter and start wandering
around there's no way to find the nexuses out (other than aimless
wandering).

## Navigation

Don't try to make a map of Nothing because you can't.

## Adventuring

All of the mobiles here cast detonate spells, but they aren't too high
of a level to worry about it.

elder cultists - widow tear gemstone

senior cultists - fireheart gemstone

disiple - diamond

devotee - ruby

Every room on this plane is Lloydable. That means that you can set
recall to any room, set up a campfire and sleep sweet dreams. Watch out
for some rooms which you can't regenerate in. If a group member dies
here, have a psi cast planar anchor and have them shift to the anchor.
Otherwise, they will have to have their corpse eulogied/threnodied/led
back from shift.
