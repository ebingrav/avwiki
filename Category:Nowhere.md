*Somewhere in the flux between the Elemental Planes is a vast stretch of
empty space. The void has many strange and unusual properties that leak
out to planes of substance.*

*In the vast stretches of this plane, there exists a cult of nihilist
fanatics whose existence lies in the destruction of everything which
isn't nothing.*
