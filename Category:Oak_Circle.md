*It is said that to the west of
[Stonehall](:Category:_Stonehall.md "wikilink"), there is a sacred
circle of oak trees where dwell a clan of
[sprites](Sprites.md "wikilink"). Whether this is true, ye shall have to
see.*

**Level Range:** 8-10

**Builder:** Crom

## Directions

Walking route from [Nom](Nom.md "wikilink"): n, 9w, n.

Walking route from [Sol](Sol.md "wikilink"): 2e, n *or* n, w, \[w\].

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [sprite
guard](Wood_Sprite.md "wikilink") (note: there are two).

## Connections

Oak Circle is most commonly accessed from
[Stonehall](:Category:_Stonehall.md "wikilink") from the east. However,
it also has links to [Fewmaster's
Folly](:Category:_Fewmaster's_Folly.md "wikilink") along its southern
border and [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") along its
western and northern borders.

## Navigation

Starting from the east, follow the wooded trail west and under the
[river](:Category:_Rivers_Of_Avatar.md "wikilink") to reach Oak Circle
proper. Here, four giant oaks form a glade. Exits from the areas can be
found by simply walking from the centre of the glade in any direction.
Access to the upper floors of the sprites' home can be gained by an
opening in each tree as you walk away from centre of the glade.

The northwest and southwest tree connect on the second floor, as do the
northeast and southeast trees. On the third floor, it is the northern
trees which connect and the southern. On the fourth floor, the
northeastern tree connects to both the northwestern and the
southeastern.

It is only the northeastern tree which goes all the way to fifth, and
top, floor - also known as the Star Room.

## Adventuring

This [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") holds nothing of any
interest in the way of [equipment](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink").
However, due to its proximity to
[Stonehall](:Category:_Stonehall.md "wikilink"),
[Sol](Sol.md "wikilink")'s free spell-ups for characters
[level](Level.md "wikilink") 10 and under, and the fact that all the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") are unarmed (apart from the sprite
watching the path), it is a good place to gather
[XP](Experience_Points.md "wikilink").

Starting with the deer and squirrels, you can move up to the sprites
which tend to be tougher in order of their age. The sprites have a
tendency to [assist](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink") and they are good, so
will lower your [alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink"). If so, a quick
trip down to [Fewmaster's
Folly](:Category:_Fewmaster's_Folly.md "wikilink") will quickly help to
return your [alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink") to good once more.

This [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") is a good testing ground
before moving on to the more dangerous
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink"). If you can't deal with
everything here comfortably, then you are probably not ready to head
into more dangerous territories.
