## Navigation

There's a door called "the steel" which I cannot find out how to open
(where the question mark is on the map). If anyone knows please share!
(Keyfinder reports that 'There is no key.') **Zahri adds:** the door led
east to the collapsing bridge, though once you were at the bridge you
could not go back west. It was impossible to get through.

## Adventuring

## Affects

As of October 2011, the area features a small increase in experience
