Each [object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") has a set of "flags" that
affect it; some may have none, some may have many. Object pages on this
Wiki list each [object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")'s *default*
flagsâ€”those that they have upon creation. An individual
[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")'s default flags may be changed
to some degree over time via certain actions, such as by
[donating](Donate "wikilink") it or by [casting](Cast "wikilink")
certain [spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") (like '[enchant
armor](Enchant_Armor "wikilink")' or '[rune](Rune "wikilink")' or
'[ward](Ward "wikilink")') on it. Some flags even affect how certain
[spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") may affect those
[objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") that have them in return. Pages
for each object flag are all listed below.
