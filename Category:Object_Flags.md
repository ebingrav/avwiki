Each [object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") has a set of "flags"
that affect it; some may have none, some may have many. Object pages on
this Wiki list each [object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")'s
*default* flagsâ€”those that they have upon creation. An individual
[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")'s default flags may be
changed to some degree over time via certain actions, such as by
[donating](Donate.md "wikilink") it or by [casting](Cast.md "wikilink")
certain [spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") (like '[enchant
armor](Enchant_Armor.md "wikilink")' or '[rune](Rune.md "wikilink")' or
'[ward](Ward.md "wikilink")') on it. Some flags even affect how certain
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") may affect those
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") that have them in return.
Pages for each object flag are all listed below.
