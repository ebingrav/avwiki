*"The Stage of Suffering." That's what they call the floor of
[Noctopia's](:Category:Noctopia "wikilink") Obsidian Arena. It is the
plane's largest structure, and an everlasting monument to the cruelty of
the Dark Fae. They gather in the stands in large numbers, eager to rub
elbows with the Elite, and protected by automaton guards. [The Grand
Duke](Duke_Malafont "wikilink") uses the arena as a training ground for
his soldiers, feeding them any unlucky enough to become a captive of the
Dark Fae. Rumor holds that [a dark prize](Shield_Of_Shadows "wikilink")
awaits the Noctopian strong enough to defeat all comers in the arena.*

## Directions

Head east from the [Corpse Collector](Corpse_Collector "wikilink") in
[Pits Of Blood And Chain](:Category:Pits_Of_Blood_And_Chain "wikilink")
seeking an up exit.

-or-

Examine down exits from [Obsidian Arena;
Stands](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Stands "wikilink") looking for mobs in
this area.

## Connections

The aforementioned entrance from [Pits Of Blood And
Chain](:Category:Pits_Of_Blood_And_Chain "wikilink") is a one-way exit
(needs confirmation). Not sure if the entrance from [Obsidian Arena;
Stands](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Stands "wikilink") is one-way, but I
think it is, since I haven't come across a safe-looking up exit from the
floor.

This area is loaded with 7 mob, nospell, det (read: suicidal) entrances
to [Obsidian Arena;
Stands](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Stands "wikilink").

## Navigation

North and a bit east from the [Pits Of Blood And
Chain](:Category:Pits_Of_Blood_And_Chain "wikilink") entrance is [Duke
Malafont](Duke_Malafont "wikilink"). See [Gear In Obsidian Arena;
Floor](:Category:Gear_In_Obsidian_Arena;_Floor "wikilink") for more
information.

## Adventuring

If you're after the gear, be careful with [Paehandra Of The
Moon](Paehandra_Of_The_Moon "wikilink") and her tendency to cast
martyrdom. Also note that the [Dark Fae
Beastmasters](Dark_Fae_Beastmaster "wikilink") are particularly
annoying. They like to stay one room away from your group and snipe you,
preventing you from regenning. When you kill them they spawn a
[Rampaging Mastador](Rampaging_Mastador "wikilink"), which stomps gear.
