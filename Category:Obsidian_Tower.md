*Not too long ago, the North-East tower of the wall of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink") was a place where little
happened. The guards performed their duties, and kept the rif raf away
from the villages inside of the wall. That all changed when one day
[Tannah Machadae](Tannah_Machadae.md "wikilink") appeared out of
nowhere. With her geomancing powers and her pack of
[trolls](Trolls.md "wikilink") and [ogres](Ogres.md "wikilink") she
quickly decimated the company of guards and laid waste to the
surrounding lands. She claimed the watch tower as her personal domicile,
altering it from normal stone to obsidian, to suit her personal taste
better. Now the black needle stands as a bitter reminder of who controls
this part of the land, and what she has done to it.*

## Connections

[Tortured Terrain](:Category:Tortured_Terrain.md "wikilink")

## Navigation

To get inside you'll need the [Key To The
Gate](Key_To_The_Gate "wikilink"). One copy of this item loads in the
[Barrier Wastes](:Category:Barrier_Wastes.md "wikilink") on the [Cave
Troll](Cave_Troll "wikilink") who is also part of the [Rough Band Of Tin
Quest](Rough_Band_Of_Tin_Quest "wikilink"). Another copy loads on the
[Female Rogue](Female_Rogue "wikilink") in [Desiccated
Farmland](:Category:Desiccated_Farmland.md "wikilink").

## Adventuring

This is prime soloing ground for casters, although it is not very big.
If you [sneak](Sneak.md "wikilink") and [move
hidden](Move_Hidden.md "wikilink") then you just have to worry about the
[cubs](Quicksilver_Wolf_Cub.md "wikilink"), the
[lion](Mithril_Lion.md "wikilink"), and the [Sand
Elemental](Sand_Elemental "wikilink") (the last two do not wander). You
can set recall at the top of the tower and the trap door at the top will
prevent cubs from wandering up (the trap door does not need a key). Keys
are important in this area. The guard at the top will have the key for
the the lion and the [golem](Rock_Golem.md "wikilink"). The
[Lezgnar](Lezgnar "wikilink") has the key to the main
[wolf](Quicksilver_Wolf.md "wikilink") and
[Tannah](Tannah_Machadae.md "wikilink"). Tannah is usually not worth it
due to the [Black Aura](Black_Aura "wikilink"). Tannah has the key for
the [Magma Monster](Magma_Monster "wikilink").
