## Navigation

## Adventuring

This area was highly popular 10 years ago when the sewers area
(connected via an entrance west of the first intersection) still
existed, with a red dragon bearing some very decent hr/dr gear for
lowmort. These days the city is generally ignored by lowmorts in the
15-25, given the high alignment of the mobs, wimpy flags on
citizens/girls/boys, and the availability of better experience
elsewhere. The shopkeepers are excellent XP, but are large and some
wield. The dragon knights and lords in the citadel to the east of the
monk are good experience, as are the various paiges and servants. The
gold dragon is quite big and generally avoided. This area does connect
to [North of Ofcol](:Category:_North_Of_Ofcol.md "wikilink"), where
tangible experience for 38+ lowmorts abounds.
