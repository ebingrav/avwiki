*Driven out of their homes the citizens of Ofcol have had little place
to go. Amidst the chaos of Midgaardia, [Captain
Jacklyn](Captain_Jacklyn "wikilink") was able to help the citizens of
Ofcol flee and seek out sactuary with [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink") in
[Midgaard](:Category:Midgaard "wikilink"). When they were faced with
very little shelter many were turned away. These refugees found their
way to a clearing North West of the city and set up camp within the
forest.*

## Connections

-   [Highways/Great Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink")

## Navigation

Area is a three-by-four mesh of interconnected rooms, with some
campfires and tents on the sides. Navigation is very simple.

## Adventuring

The area is a twin area to the [Hospice Refugee
Camp](:Category:Hospice_Refugee_Camp "wikilink"), but features somewhat
higher level guards and refugees, and as such is good for those that
wish to level further by doing [Tannah's](Tannah_Machadae "wikilink")
work after they are done with the Hospice camp.

The guards wear the almost-grandfathered
[Ofcol](:Category:Ofcol "wikilink") gear, for nostalgia's sake, and the
refugees are generally without any gear.

Overall, it's a small area and is cleared easily.
