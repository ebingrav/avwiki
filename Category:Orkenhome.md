*Near the [remains of the kingdom of the High
Drow](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria.md "wikilink"), there exists an
underground city of [orcs](Orcs.md "wikilink") called Orkenhome. Though
no one is quite sure why, the [orcs](Orcs.md "wikilink") of this region
aren't like others of their kind. They don't make war, they earn their
keep through labor, and, worst of all, they act downright civilized.*

**Level Range:** 23-29

**Builder:** Teneaos

## Connections

Orkenhome has but one entrance and exit, and that is with the [Ruins of
Reveria](:Category:Ruins_Of_Reveria.md "wikilink"), which connect to the
city to the east via a massive gate and a limestone tunnel.

## Navigation

Essentially a single wheel with four spokes leading out from the centre,
Orkenhome is easy to navigate.

The north-south spoke forms the Main Street and is lined with shops,
with the temple on the western side of the southern end. The east-west
spokes are shorter and are lined with houses.

A few other houses, shops or secret rooms can be found leading off of
this pattern as well.

## Adventuring

From levels 20-25, the wandering "boy", "priest", and "citizen" mobs
here will give upwards of 300xp per kill. Non-wandering shopkeepers
along with mobs in the bar and temple rooms can give as much as 450xp
(up to roughly 500xp just after a reboot). This area still provides
solid XP (for most races) up to level 30, with XP-per-kill slowly
dwindling off to around 50 by the late 20s, but kills coming very
rapidly assuming you follow the gear and spell training advice here on
the site.

A number of mobs here can hit for 20-40 damage per strike through bot
spellups (roughly -500 AC) with some of the shopkeepers (particularly
the book store owner and the armorer) hitting for as much as 80 on
occasion, and several mobs assist against evil players. Be careful with
a lowbie caster, particularly sprites and elves/drow as they tend to
have rather low HP pools.

Brute classes, on the other hand, tend to have a very easy time here.

Almost all mobs here are good, so watch your
[alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink").
