*The miserable existence of the orphans of
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink") prompted the Solacians
to action, and the result was the Orphanage off Harvest Road. What they
wanted was a place to care for the orphans, nourish them, clothe them
and keep them safe from undesirable elements. What they got was not at
all what they expected.*

**Level Range:** 4-8

## Connections

## Navigation

## Adventuring

The orphanage is just north of
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink") and south of
[Sol](Sol.md "wikilink"). The majority of
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") will respond to 'orphan', and they
will [assist](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink") and
[flee](Wimpy_Mobs.md "wikilink"), so be careful fighting in
[rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") with large swarms. Some will
also [steal gold](Thieving_Mobs.md "wikilink"), so don't go wandering
around with a huge chunk of [change in your
pocket](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink").

There are plenty of orphans of equal difficulty that wander through the
complex, so the highlights are:

3e3n from the entrance is Cook (gray skinned goblin on scan) which
aggies and wields a knife. East of him is One-eye, who has the [scarlet
silk sash](Scarlet_Silk_Sash.md "wikilink") ([+con
gear](:Category:_Con_Gear.md "wikilink") for waist, usually wearable by
[level](Level.md "wikilink") 4). One-eye is also the start and end of a
short quest which produces a cure serious potion ([Herbal
Tea](Flask_Of_Herbal_Tea.md "wikilink")) as a reward. Down from the cook
is a small passage; at the end lies a bit of history - you'll see the
last of the wargs (also where you might have ended up by tele'ing to
warg).

3es from the entrance is a Solace townguard - he's a bit easier than the
ones in the town (still tougher than the rest of the mobs), but wears
the same [black platemail](Black_Platemail.md "wikilink") - decent gear
if you don't have [target armor](Target_Armor.md "wikilink") (a
[grandfathered](:Category:_Grandfathered.md "wikilink") item) or
[glowing suit of banded
mail](Glowing_Suit_Of_Banded_Mail.md "wikilink"). South from him is the
inspector and the master of the orphanage - the master is sanced and not
really worth fighting.

Going through the closed doors, either 5e or 3e2n2e will take you into
the "real" orphanage. Watch for Hamish ("taller, meaner orphan" on
[scan](Scan.md "wikilink")) as he'll
[aggy](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink").

Inside the real orphanage, there are two
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") that
[wander](Wandering_Mobs.md "wikilink") with keys to locked areas. The
orphan basher has the key to Bones' room (which is in the southeast
corner of the orphanage) - Bones' himself has a
[potion](:Category:_Potions.md "wikilink") of refresh + cure light - and
the caretaker has the key to the store room (en of "Bottom of the
Staircase" room). The store room has another chest which I couldn't find
the key to, but apparently it contains held int gear same as the orb of
knowledge. \*\* The chest is not locked\*\*

2e from "bottom of the staircase" takes you to an intersection, south of
which is Doctor Leech. He's got [bloodstained
trousers](Bloodstained_Trousers.md "wikilink") - good [wis
gear](:Category:_Wis_Gear.md "wikilink") for legs, and normally wearable
by [level](Level.md "wikilink") 4. North and up from the intersection is
Matron Fey, who you won't want to fight, but her journal might provide
some hints as to how to finish the mini quest. Through a closed door,
east will take you to Tulip, who has [+str
gear](:Category:_Str_Gear.md "wikilink") for arms (not as good as the
[strongman's bracers](Strongman's_Bracers.md "wikilink"), but decent for
those without them.). Farther east and south will land you in Molin's
(it's a one-way exit.)
