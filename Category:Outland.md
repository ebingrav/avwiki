*The cracked, rough surface of Outland has long been the scene of
bloodshed between the githzerai and the githyanki. The githyanki
established supremacy and pushed the githzerai back into their keep
where they have bided their time, growing stronger and preparing to one
day retake the surface lands, while the githyanki have wasted their
skills on foolish Midgaardian interlopers. Now the time has come and the
githzerai have launched a counter-offensive, sending their forces
against their ancient foes. Tread lightly, as neither group cares for
you!*
