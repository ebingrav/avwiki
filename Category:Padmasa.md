Although part of the island is a bustling trading bazaar with visitors

## Adventuring

If you are using Vapul as the pp, be aware that Vapul is aggressive and
backstabs, so use caution.

East from Vapul to fight the hall of masters. Each mob except Heruta is
a spell caster (including disintegrate), but they do not assist. They
are aggressive only to sleeping players. Heruta has a
[nectar](nectar "wikilink") and will eat corpses. This room is popular
for area casters, and can usually rack 600-700xp at once.

2w from Vapul is the bottom of the Shaft. One level up the Shaft, go 3e
and you'll be at [Doom](Doom "wikilink"). The eyes, ears, and mouth of
Doom are on the path and are aggressive but not difficult.
[Doom](Doom "wikilink") is portable so you might skip the guardians.

One layer further up is the shaft again and 2s is [Administrator
Gru-Dzek](Administrator_Gru-Dzek "wikilink"). The imps guarding his room
are aggressive, but the administrator is popular target for the [Wafer
With Essence](Wafer_With_Essence "wikilink").

Up again is the floor with [Unfinished
Doom](Unfinished_Doom "wikilink"), a high-lowmort mob.

The room below the [Unfinished Doom](Unfinished_Doom "wikilink") is the
same room as below [Doom](Doom "wikilink"). It is full of hard-hitting
aggressive cockroaches who are corpse eaters. If caught and in mortal
danger, flee northwards towards safety.

Up again frol Unfinished Doom's level is the first underground layer
with exits to north, south, east, and west. One move in each direction
takes you to two non-aggie Padmasa guards, who are decent xp and do not
assist. One more move past the guards takes you to one of the four
Mesomaster Scanners, who are aggressive and less xp than the guards.

Continuing to the top of the shaft, you can head 2n (to get the key that
will allow you back through the bottom of the shaft) or east will take
you to the top of Padmasa. This is a good area to exercise area spells,
as the mobs are small but swarmy, easily reaching 6-7 per room. A few
mobs will assist, and the pack of imps and the Magician Thrembode
(you'll see his sanctuary aura on scan) will aggie.

Once at the corners of the Padmasa courtyard, you can head up to the
walls; there are lots of trolls and imps up here. The trolls aggie and
see sneak/movehidden/invis so target them.

Going eastish from the Tetralobe/Padmasa citadel are gates. There's a
troll/imp set here. Three east from there is the pp of imp army, biggish
aggie mob, as well as General Lukash, who can hit pretty hard but
doesn't aggie. To the east and north of the army there are a five sets
of dragons that are worth ok xp, but are sanced, aggie, and will tail.
Each dragon has an attendant who is unsanced but also aggressive.

This area can be good for lowhero solo or lowmort groups, and has a
couple of useful pieces of gear. A caster can play with df/acid rain in
the courtyard, and the Doom, Administrator and Heruta's room are often
farmed for the gear and consumables.
