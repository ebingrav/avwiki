*Many travelers have returned to [Nom](Nom "wikilink") the
[Healer](:Category:_Healers "wikilink"), telling him wondrous stories
about a fabled courtyard south of the
[meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink"). [Nom](Nom "wikilink") usually
only smiles and nods, closing his eyes as a peaceful look crosses his
features. Sometimes [Nom](Nom "wikilink") speaks of the occupants,
mentioning the eager young [priests](:Category:_Priests "wikilink") who
came to him in ages long since past, petitioning to have a place set up
for the newcomers from
[mudschool](:Category:_Avatar_Mudschool "wikilink") who might wish to
learn, to understand; those who seek guidance in their adventures in
this realm.*

## Adventuring

Although there isn't really any great [gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink")
here, this is a great [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") for a few
other reasons. First off it's good
[experience](Experience_Points "wikilink") at [early
levels](:Category:_Lowmort_Levels_1-10 "wikilink") although you might
want to avoid the [stationary mobs](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink") mobs in
each [god](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses "wikilink")'s temple because
they are a little harder. In addition, if you [look](Look "wikilink") at
each [mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") before fighting it you will
notice that they give a little insight into how each
[god](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses "wikilink") will benefit and
detriment his/her [worshippers](Worship "wikilink"). The [stationary
mobs](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink") are exceptionally insightful.
