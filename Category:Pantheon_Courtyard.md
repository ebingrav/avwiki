*Many travelers have returned to [Nom](Nom.md "wikilink") the
[Healer](:Category:_Healers.md "wikilink"), telling him wondrous stories
about a fabled courtyard south of the
[meadow](:Category:_Meadow.md "wikilink"). [Nom](Nom.md "wikilink")
usually only smiles and nods, closing his eyes as a peaceful look
crosses his features. Sometimes [Nom](Nom.md "wikilink") speaks of the
occupants, mentioning the eager young
[priests](:Category:_Priests.md "wikilink") who came to him in ages long
since past, petitioning to have a place set up for the newcomers from
[mudschool](:Category:_Avatar_Mudschool.md "wikilink") who might wish to
learn, to understand; those who seek guidance in their adventures in
this realm.*

## Connections

This area is connected to the [Meadow](:Category:_Meadow.md "wikilink").

## Navigation

This area is a square, with mobs explaining the deities on Avatar on
various paths off of the square. See the map for more detail.

## Adventuring

Although there isn't really any great
[gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") here, this is a great
[area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") for a few other reasons. First
off it's good [experience](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") at [early
levels](:Category:_Lowmort_Levels_1-10.md "wikilink") although you might
want to avoid the [stationary mobs](Sentinel_Mobs.md "wikilink") mobs in
each [god](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses.md "wikilink")'s temple because
they are a little harder. In addition, if you [look](Look.md "wikilink")
at each [mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") before fighting it you will
notice that they give a little insight into how each
[god](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses.md "wikilink") will benefit and
detriment his/her [worshippers](Worship.md "wikilink"). The [stationary
mobs](Sentinel_Mobs.md "wikilink") are exceptionally insightful.
