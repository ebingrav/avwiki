*South of [the Crystalmir](:Category:_Crystalmir_Lake.md "wikilink") is
a peninsula of the most desirable land in the known world. Warm weather
and fertile soil atop a highly defensible rocky peak with a fantastic
view over [the ocean](:Category:_Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes.md "wikilink").
Throughout the years, various noble families have attempted to claim the
point, but the trouble is, it's covered in
[minotaurs](Minotaurs.md "wikilink"). Though naturally fairly docile,
they are extremely territorial, and can be quite dangerous to would-be
explorers or real estate agents.*

**Level Range:** 27-32
