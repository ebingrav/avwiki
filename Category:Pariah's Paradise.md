*Cities like Midgaard are built upon laws and the governing bodies that
enforce those laws. For most these are welcome securities, but a handful
of shady individuals find them to be stifling constraints. For them, the
only life worth living is one free of arbitrary rules and a haughty air
of civility. Midgaard's worst kept secret, then, is its seething
underworld: a parody of Midgaard above, carved out of its own aging
infrastructure, sewers and foundations which the citizens above happily
throw away and ignore. Its denizens farcically call it Paradise. Rumor
has it that even Midgaard's own official staff will on occasion indulge
themselves in Paradise's brand of violent entertainment.*

## Navigation

## Adventuring

To get inside this area through the main entrance you need to bribe the
legitimate businessman at the entrance. Give him 12000 coins and he will
let you in. To get in through the other entrance you have to pass a mob
that uses blackjack, so be careful if you're not a rogue type.
