An alphabetical list of all AVATAR MUD pets.

*You can buy pets in any [pet shop](:Category:_Pet_Shops "wikilink").
The number of pets you can own is limited, and varies between
characters. This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets. To
[buy](Buy "wikilink") a particular pet, you must be its
[level](Level "wikilink") or higher.*

*When you [buy](Buy "wikilink") a pet, it automatically
[follows](Follow "wikilink") and [groups](Group "wikilink") with you. To
direct your pet's actions, use the [ORDER](Order "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"). Note that a pet will \*not\*
[follow](Follow "wikilink") you through a [portal](Portals "wikilink")
or [nexus](Nexuses "wikilink") unless [ordered](Order "wikilink").*

*You are responsible for the actions of your pets. Conversely, if you
attack someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked the
player. It is a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labeled
'[(Charmed)](Charmed_Flag "wikilink")'. To release a pet from service,
use the [FREE](Free "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink").*

*You may name your pet as you buy it by typing "[buy](Buy "wikilink")
<pet> <petname>". No one will see a visible name change, but you can
then [order](Order "wikilink") your pet by the name you choose. Do NOT
name your pets after common [healer](:Category:_Healers "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"), such as [Nom](Nom "wikilink") or
[Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"), as it causes
[portal](Portal "wikilink")/[teleportation](Teleport "wikilink")
misdirections.*

Syntax: [buy](Buy "wikilink") <pet> <petname>.
