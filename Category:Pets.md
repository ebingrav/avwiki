An alphabetical list of all AVATAR MUD pets.

*You can buy pets in any [pet shop](:Category:_Pet_Shops.md "wikilink").
The number of pets you can own is limited, and varies between
characters. This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets. To
[buy](Buy.md "wikilink") a particular pet, you must be its
[level](Level.md "wikilink") or higher.*

*When you [buy](Buy.md "wikilink") a pet, it automatically
[follows](Follow.md "wikilink") and [groups](Group.md "wikilink") with
you. To direct your pet's actions, use the [ORDER](Order.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"). Note that a pet will
\*not\* [follow](Follow.md "wikilink") you through a
[portal](Portals.md "wikilink") or [nexus](Nexuses.md "wikilink") unless
[ordered](Order.md "wikilink").*

*You are responsible for the actions of your pets. Conversely, if you
attack someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked the
player. It is a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labeled
'[(Charmed)](Charmed_Flag.md "wikilink")'. To release a pet from
service, use the [FREE](Free.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink").*

*You may name your pet as you buy it by typing "[buy](Buy.md "wikilink")
<pet> <petname>". No one will see a visible name change, but you can
then [order](Order.md "wikilink") your pet by the name you choose. Do
NOT name your pets after common
[healer](:Category:_Healers.md "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"), such as [Nom](Nom "wikilink") or
[Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"), as it causes
[portal](Portal.md "wikilink")/[teleportation](Teleport.md "wikilink")
misdirections.*

Syntax: [buy](Buy.md "wikilink") <pet> <petname>.
