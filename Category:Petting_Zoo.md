## Adventuring

When I make a new [character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink"),
inevitably they swing by the petting zoo. It seems to be a commonly run
[lowbie area](:Category:_Lowmort_1-10_Areas "wikilink"), probably
because of its age, the fact it is devoid of
[aggies](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), and its proximity to
[Sol](Sol "wikilink"). It's a nice [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink")
for [exp](Experience_Points "wikilink"), but its real appeal is the two
[weapons](:Category:_Melee_Weapons "wikilink") that can be found there:
the [Golden Unicorn Horn](Golden_Unicorn_Horn "wikilink") and the [claw
of Tyran-o-Bambie](Claw_Of_Tyran-O-Bambie "wikilink").

Only be aware, that some of the other items that can be found there are
cursed. This means it is not possible to remove or drop them without
previously having cast '[remove curse](Remove_Curse "wikilink")'. The
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") itself is very straightforward, and
there aren't really any surprises from the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"), except for the Pig who has been
known to [bite and poison](Biting_Mobs "wikilink").
