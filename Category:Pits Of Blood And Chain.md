*Beneath the Obsidian Arena lie a series of pits, chains and prisons.
The cells house captives and victims from across the cosmos, tending by
demons and Fae so twisted, even the other Noctopians shun them.*

**Builder:** Dev

## Directions

From the [Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink") room in [Under The
Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars "wikilink") go as far north as you can,
then west, then more north. Check periodically for hidden up exits. Once
you find one, bash it open and go up to enter the main part of this
area. Note that once the door repops behind you you won't be able to go
back down unless you have a psionicist who will be able to see a 'chain'
in the room after going up, which when pulled will open down.

## Connections

Besides the aforementioned entrance, there's an up exit east of the
[Corpse Collector](Corpse_Collector "wikilink") that leads to [Obsidian
Arena; Floor](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Floor "wikilink")

## Navigation

When you first enter this place you'll find yourself in "a hanging
cage". You need to pick a door to access the rest of the area.

## Adventuring

Bring a rogue to pick your way out of the cage. Avoid fighting the
[Corpse Collector](Corpse_Collector "wikilink") if at all possible. He
shows up on scan as " A staggeringly huge golem is coated in corpses and
gore." He hits insanely hard (DESTRUCTIVE is common) and drags off the
players which he defeats. Also, veil is useless against it.
