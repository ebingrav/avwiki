*The Elemental Plane of Water is a plane consisting entirely of liquid.
The beings that call this plane home are usually very peaceful unless
summoned to another plane. There they either follow the commands of the
one who summoned them or go berserk trying to find a way home. However,
strange things have begun to happen in the Elemental Planes, and the
Plane of Water is no different. Normally placid elementals have become
violent beasts, attacking anyone and anything that invades their
domain.*

## Directions

[Plane](Planeshift "wikilink") to [Water](:Category:Water "wikilink").

## Connections

[Reckoning](:Category:Reckoning "wikilink"): 3dwd from shift.

## Navigation

maelstrom: s e from shift. Alternate directions include 4n e or 2n e n.

nexus to nowhere: 2n, e, u

[lloydable](lloydable "wikilink") room (Stone Shelter): 2n e u. Or n e n
u. Or s e s u (passing by Maelstrom on your way).

From stone shelter to maelstrom: d n.

The area is mostly a 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 cube, or so it seems. Not much
bigger or smaller than that though, that's for sure.  
There are a few minor irregularities in the exits. That is to say, you
won't always get back to the same room if you backtrack your steps. If
you run here more often, it's useful to know roughly where backtracking
will and will not take tou back to where you came from.

If you go down from the stone shelter, the rooms e, se, s, sw, w, su, n
and the stone shelter itself are all directly connected without any
irregularities. So if the anchor is in place, that's a great set of
rooms to get some xp in without getting lost. Feel free to expand this
knowledge with more rooms connected here that allow backtracking. (I am
pretty sure down from the shelter, 2 rooms in any direction are okay.
ee, ww, nn, ss, dd. Need to check on ne, nw, nu, nd, en, es, eu, ed, wn,
ws, wu, wd, sd.)

## Adventuring

This is a nice place for a group of \~5 to get exp. It only has one
sentinel mob at shift, and you can get a [Ring Of
Water](Ring_Of_Water "wikilink") by killing one of the three
[deadlies](Deadly_Water_Elemental "wikilink").

Almost every room in this [area](:Category:Lord_Areas "wikilink") has
eight exits. This creates two problems for us:

-   Sudden swarms can appear. Sometimes you can get away with running
    some small group exp here, but more often than not you get suddenly
    slammed by a huge wave. Sometimes this happens at shift, other times
    when spells are low.
-   This area is hard to regen in. Here are a few good places to regen:
    -   Inside the maelstrom. From shift go s, e to reach the room with
        the maelstrom in it. Enter the maelstrom, deal with the
        [surly](Surly_Water_Elemental "wikilink") (stabber), and regen.
        If you want to you can take on the [water elemental
        ruler](Water_Elemental_Ruler "wikilink") (who holds the
        [tattoo](Watermark_Tattoo "wikilink")) to the east. Otherwise
        your group must portal out.
    -   The stone shelter: 2e n u from shift. This is the
        [lloydable](lloydable "wikilink") room on this
        [plane](:Category:Lord_Planes "wikilink"). From here you can
        enter a nexus to [Nothing](:Category:Nothing "wikilink") if you
        choose.
    -   [Thorngate](:Category:Thorngate "wikilink"). If you win a fight
        by the skin of your teeth you might as well go back home and
        regen up proper. Consider making a
        [shrine](Create_Shrine "wikilink") 2e. Retake shift when you're
        good and ready.

-   -   If you see a room with 3 invis mobs on scan (red eyes), that's
        icesphere room.

eventually these mobs will get their own pages, but for now here's the
levels of some of the mobs in water proper:

| A lesser Water Elemental    | 140   |                                                                      |
| A water elemental           | 142   |                                                                      |
| A large water elemental     | 145   | Some are stabbers                                                    |

## Frost Giant Quest

Get a group together of approx 6-10 People .

Shift for this run is Water . After shift you will need to Portal to
Rholm to start the Quest .

When you start the quest Rholm will tell you of an area that has been
frozen by a powerful spirit .

At this point Shift home and regen . Shift again to water and find the
Ice Efreet . When the giant in question walks into the room it will say

upon entering the room with Ice Effreet The Essence of the Frost flows
through <giant name here>! <giant name here> roars with pleasure!

At this point you could theoretically flee and return to Rholm , however
you can kill the efreet first and get his loot.

PP back to Rholm and He will tell you that you have discovered your
Elemental Essence. He will ask if you are ready to become a Frost Giant
. Say Ready and go through the process. At the end of the process he
will ask if you wish to Re-roll . The choice is completely yours . When
I went through it I did and gained double my mana (up to 1100 now) and
lost 2.3 K HP .
