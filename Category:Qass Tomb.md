*"The Qass once roamed the [Qanza
Prairie](:Category:_Qanza_Prairie "wikilink") freely, hunting the
abundant wildlife. They worshipped within the fossil filled chalk
formations of the northwest prairie, burying their dead within the caves
below. When the red rock fell from the sky, it brought plague, death,
and worse. The Qass were eliminated, except for [a
shaman](Odertha "wikilink") who worked tirelessly to cleanse the holy
rocks and the tombs below." From 'A History of the [Qanza
Prairie](:Category:_Qanza_Prairie "wikilink")'.*
