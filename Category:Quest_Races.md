Quest races are unlocked by doing quests; for giants this is reaching
some specific part of the Lord areas, and for dragons this involves
defeating Bane.

Both of these quests are entirely optional, in no way forcing a player
to pick a color or element, and can be redone as often as required -
thus allowing a player to revert back to base race (*Hill Giant* and
*Red Dragon*) or to change to another color/element entirely.
