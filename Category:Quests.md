Quests may be automatic (such as ticket quests), or require intervention
from a player (Typically [Heroes](:Category:Hero "wikilink") or
[Lords](:Category:Lord "wikilink")),
[Angel](:Category:Angels "wikilink"), or
[Immortal](:Category:Immortals "wikilink").

Since one-time Quests Events organized by the Immortals and the Quest
Staff generally do not repeat themselves, here on wiki we focus on the
repeatable in-game quests that do not require any immortal assistance.

Points](Quest_Points "wikilink"), and the [Quest Point
Catalog](:Category:Quest_Point_Catalog "wikilink").
