*Rangers are a [grand-fathered
class](:Category:_Grandfathered_Classes "wikilink") that no longer fits
into the overall scheme of AVATAR. Since their replacement class
([Archers](:Category:_Archers "wikilink")) was so disimilar to them in
gameplay, some Rangers opted to keep their old class, knowing full-well
that no future development for the class would ever occur.*

**Abbreviation:** Ran.

**[Prime Requisite](Prime_Requisite "wikilink"):**
