*Rangers are a [grand-fathered
class](:Category:_Grandfathered_Classes.md "wikilink") that no longer
fits into the overall scheme of AVATAR. Since their replacement class
([Archers](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink")) was so disimilar to them
in gameplay, some Rangers opted to keep their old class, knowing
full-well that no future development for the class would ever occur.*

**Abbreviation:** Ran.
