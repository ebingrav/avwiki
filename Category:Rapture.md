*Leaving the Walkways and hugging roots of the Barrier Mountains, in the
depths of the eastern marsh lies a small town. Barely an outpost of a
much greater power, this community is torn from the inside.*

*Heavily reliant on slave labor, the news of Midgaardian arrivals has
stirred hope buried for centuries, and the oppressed battle the
oppressor. Choose a side and see the conflict come to a conclusion, or
don't! Why not settle down instead, leave the life of an adventurer for
a while, and try your skills at animal husbandry?*

## Adventuring

Area is small and easy to explore fully. It features a [primary
quest](Rapture_Slavery_Quest "wikilink") that involves picking a side as
explained in the area's intro and then proceeding to eliminate the other
side. This quest is not group-based and is soloable by heroes.

Secondary quest involves [animal
husbandry](Animal_Handler_Quest "wikilink"), is very difficult to solo
even for 999s, and will reward the entire group accomplishing it.

From the builder:

*Rapture is a small area designed for small players - those not yet
superhero and willing to group with one or more similarly-sized players
while exploring. The area's primary quest is not group-based, but should
be soloable even for this type of an explorer.* *At the same time
Rapture is designed for very large players, as well as those willing to
let others know just how 999 their superheroes are - as they attempt and
likely perish at their Animal Husbandry efforts, which are very much a
group-based affair.* *Lords are free to rummage around, but they will
not be able to do the area's quests, which bear hero-like rewards
anyway.* *I hope you have fun, as well as use this opportunity to flex
your larger alts and see just how buff you are when presented with a
butchering knife.*
