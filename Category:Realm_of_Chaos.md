*The push and pull of Law and Chaos as they try to influence the planes
is rarely noticed by planar inhabitants though they sometimes play a
role for one side or the other. Champions of either side usually act
indirectly but sometimes a hands-on approach is needed.*

*The kaleidoscope of their interactions can be seen in the furthest
reaches of the realms and even more so at the doorsteps of Chaos and
Law.*
