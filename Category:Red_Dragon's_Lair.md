*Somewhere beneath [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink") lies
the lair of [Nigurathus](Nigurathus.md "wikilink"), the ancient Red
Dragon. Rumor says that the lair is more of a breeding ground, and that
adventurers who go in looking for one dragon are likely to find many
more than they bargained for, and maybe more than they can handle. Some
say that [Jake the Thorn-Slayer](Jake_The_Thorn-Slayer.md "wikilink"),
bartender of the Dragon's Bane in
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink"), offers a reward to those
who slay [Nigurathus](Nigurathus.md "wikilink").*

**Level Range:** 51-51

2e, 3s, 4e, 2s, 2e, 2n, d.

## Connections

-   [Wildwood](:Category:Wildwood.md "wikilink")
    ([map](Wildwood_Map.md "wikilink"))

## Navigation

Real simple layout. About 3x4 area with a few off shoots totaling 23
rooms. Northeast has the aggie guards before
[Nigurathus](Nigurathus "wikilink"). The mother (and father) is in the
northwest. Entrance from Wildwood is at the southern most point.

## Adventuring

This is a small area that is rarely run which means its xp is usually
pretty decent, but it's still small. Trouble is all dragons have [armor
ancient](Racial_Armorancient.md "wikilink"), and can
[tail](Racial_Tail.md "wikilink"), so this area is mostly run for
[Nigurathus](Nigurathus "wikilink")'s scales - a ticket for the [Heroic
Dragonscale Skirt](Heroic_Dragonscale_Skirt "wikilink").

If you give Jake [ some red dragon
scales](Some_Red_Dragon_Scales.md "wikilink") he will give you a small
moonstone gem.
