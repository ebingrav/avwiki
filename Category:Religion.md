Worship was created by Crom as a way to develop diversity within Avatar
without reinventing the wheel in regards to classes and races. The idea
of inacting a global diversity change within a pre-established system is
the primary reason that worship was designed. The idea of worship is
simple. By worshipping a god or goddess, you will then be given curses
and boons per that religious choice. In a perfect system, every god is a
viable choice, but there are definitely favorites for races and classes
based on the desires of the playerbase (or whim). A broad spectrum of
effects are changed as a result of choosing a god with a strong attempt
to make the good not outweigh the bad in regards to bonuses. The result
of this code change was to create a race-class-god dynamic that gave
players much more flexibility.

(This experimental concept was based upon the racial bonus code
developed by Snikt and was expanded by Devastant after its initial
implementation.)
