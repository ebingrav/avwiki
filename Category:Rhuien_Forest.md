*At the western edge of the continent of Eragora lies a small rain
forest, home to many exotic animals and insects. More worrisome,
however, is the large, man-sized plant life that thrives there...*

## Directions

Walking route from [Eragora default
recall](Eragora_default_recall.md "wikilink"): 2s, 3w, n, 2w, n, 2w, 3n,
w, n, 2w, n, 3w.

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested: [Rainbow
Plant](Rainbow_Plant "wikilink"),
[Guardian](Guardian_of_Eragora.md "wikilink") (of Eragora). Warning:
non-unique keyword (there is another Guardian portable in the
[Halfling's Paradise](:Category:Halfling's_Paradise.md "wikilink")
area), and both are aggressive.

## Connections

-   [Sphynx Gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate.md "wikilink")
-   [North Rhuien Forest](:Category:North_Rhuien_Forest.md "wikilink")
-   [Eragora Walkways](:Category:Eragora_Walkways.md "wikilink")

## Navigation

The area is a simple amorphous mesh of rooms with no obstacles. None of
the rooms are cursed, not even the local cloud. Navigation is simple
since the area is quite small.

## Entering Eragora Proper

When arriving from the gate the players are dumped into the first room
of the area, one by one, since the process takes a short while. Beware
that you will need to equip your gear immediately since the room you are
transferred to is not safe and may contain aggie mobs.

Also, since you will be arriving spell-less, consider immediately
recalling to the [Eragora default
recall](Eragora_default_recall "wikilink"), respell there and reequip,
and only then adventure here.

## Adventuring

The area is aggie, meaning every single mob is aggie and sees both
hidden and invisible.

As the "introductory" area, being directly connected to the Sphynx Gate,
the area serves well to set the tempo and style of later areas. The mobs
are relatively hard hitting but not overly difficult, and the main issue
(that just requires getting used to) is the lack of full spellups
players might be used to on the mainland.

With the reduced spell coverage and thus lower AC the mobs may appear to
hit harder than they would usually do against fully spelled players.
Naturally, this will also depend on your party composition.

There is no safe or nomob room in the area except the local cloud to the
far south, which is also anti-magic (you cannot spellup here), but
recallable.

All the mobs are saintly, so watch your alignment.

Unlike some other Eragoran areas, Rhuien forest will not do your CR for
you.

## Escaping Eragora

The easiest way used to be to portal to Rainbow Plant, which is a
stationary (non-agggressive) mob 2e from the gate â€“ however there are
now other mobs with the same name which are not portable. Try 2.rainbow,
3.rainbow, etc. If the Sphynx do not react to you, you are invisible.
Get visible and reenter the room.

You can walk from [Eragora Default
Recall](Eragora_Default_Recall "wikilink") fairly easily (check the
[Eragora Walkways Map](Eragora_Walkways_Map "wikilink")).
