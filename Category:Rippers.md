*If things don't seem right, claw, scratch and bite!*

*That is the motto of the Rippers, an order of fighters dedicated to
using their own natural weaponry just as effectively as most use an axe
or sword. Harnessing the animal within, Rippers learn new martial
techniques to capitalize on their own [racial
abilities](:Category:Racials.md "wikilink"), most notably their claws.
They often push their bodies to the breaking point in search of a better
understanding of the animal inside. Trainers are typically found out in
the wild, as they tend to be shunned by polite society. Like all
[Prestige Classes](:Category:Prestige_Classes.md "wikilink"), they
retain the base class's [Prime Requisite](Prime_Requisite "wikilink"),
in this case, [Strength](Strength "wikilink").*

*The integration of the Ripper's feral self is a surprisingly harmonious
one, such that the cannot become
[Berserkers](:Category:Berserkers.md "wikilink"). Likewise, they cannot
become [Paladins](:Category:Paladins.md "wikilink") as the Paladin's
weapon bond is antithetical to Ripper beliefs.*

*Sometimes, the Ripper's predeliction for wanton carnage and corpse
mutilation catches the attention of the Dark Powers, allowing them to
become [Sorcerors](:Category:Sorcerers.md "wikilink"), albeit at higher
level than [Mages](:Category:Mages.md "wikilink").*

Requirements:  
\* level 50 Warrior  
\* Low HP when speaking to the trainer  
\* Racial-Claw race  
\* Have killed a mob that gives experience, with the claw attack getting
the terminal hit.

**Abbreviation:** Rip.

## Rippers in General

Ripper is a hard hitting melee class that uses its claws rather than
weapons. When their claws are extended, [Shred](Shred "wikilink") is
activated providing for strong melee damage (including +20 HR/DR)
without the need for weapons. Rippers also possess a number of unique
abilities including:

-   [Pounce](Pounce "wikilink") (a powerful bash-like opener that costs
    HP to use),
-   [Flay](Flay "wikilink") (an attack that lowers an enemies defenses &
    increases your chance to rend, costs HP to use unless inflicted by
    [Gnash](Specimen.md "wikilink")),
-   [Maul](Maul "wikilink") (an attack that increases your damage next
    round that costs HP to use),
-   [Tear](Tear "wikilink") (the ability to tear open a corpse for
    bonuses such as hp regen).

They also gain powerful passives such as [Hound](Hound "wikilink") (an
extra attack whenever a mob dodges) and [Juke](Juke "wikilink") (an
extra dodge attempt). They also gain a permanent buff via
[Specimen](Specimen "wikilink").

Rippers do not get certain helpful curative spells such as: [Cure
Blindness](Cure_Blindness "wikilink"), [Cure
Poison](Cure_Poison "wikilink"), [Cure
Disease](Cure_Disease "wikilink"). This means stocking up on some
["casties"](:Category:Spellcasting_Gear.md "wikilink") is helpful (i.e,
the [Ceramic Vial](Ceramic_Vial "wikilink") for cure blind). They also
do not get a lot of mana, so even though they can learn spells like
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") and [Frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink") they
can't cast them very often.

Races that make powerful rippers include
[Firedrakes](Firedrakes "wikilink"), [Trolls](Trolls "wikilink") and
[Ogres](Ogres "wikilink") (and of course,
[Dragons](Dragons "wikilink")).

## Ripper Creation

In order to prestige to Ripper you need to kill a mob that gives
experience and the killing blow (terminal) has to be a claw strike. Note
that although [Miraars](Miraars "wikilink") can copy a claw race, it
cannot prestige Ripper. If your try, Korun Rentface says 'I may be old,
but I can still smell a phony. And I'm smellin' one right now...'

## Ripper Worship

The claws that ripper use are weapons created on the Ripper when they
extend (m56 for hero, m130 for lord). As such, deities such as
[Werredan](Werredan "wikilink") are most beneficial for Ripper, versus
an open hand deity such as [Gorn](Gorn "wikilink"). In fact, Ripper do
not learn the open hand ability.

## Rippers at Lord Tier

Rippers can remort to [Sorcerers](:Category:Sorcerers.md "wikilink") at
150 (human) or 300 (current race).
