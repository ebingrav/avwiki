*A half-orc river pilot beckons you onto his raft and departs, taking
you north from Moonbay village. He whistles as he poles the raft in a
steady rhythm, but pauses here and there to give some unasked for
advice.*

` "River Etuan is quite safe, no need to worry. You just need to watch`  
` where you step. Stay out of the reeds, mind you. And don't jump in,`  
` or you might not come back up. Be careful with your fishing. Some`  
` of them fish bite back. And try not to pick too many fights, as the`  
` docks make for harder folk than you might be used to. But like I`  
` said, the Etuan is as safe as a mother's embrace. You just need to`  
` treat her right."`

*The mighty River Etuan carves a path across the continent of Eragora,
from the northern highlands it grows from many tributaries swelling in
size until it flows out into the sea. A popular method of travel into
the heart of the continent, a vital trade route and popular with the
local fisherfolk it is considered by the indigenous peoples to be more
or less safe.*

## Connections

## Navigation

Starting from the river's delta that connects directly to [Moonbay
Village](:Category:Moonbay_Village "wikilink") in two places, the river
is entirely straightforward for a long way. First branch connects to
[Eragora Walkways](:Category:Eragora_Walkways "wikilink"), just south of
the [Arx Nivea](:Category:Arx_Nivea "wikilink") crossing. Arx Nivea
technically splits the area into two, with one room in the middle
connecting north and south river parts. Following the river northward it
forks; the eastern path (Black River) leads to [Healing
Springs](:Category:Healing_Springs "wikilink") connection, and further
onto the *Black Lake*, which has miniscule offshoots called *Enja Gorge*
(north) and *Moonkiss River* (east). The other fork leads westward
towards the *second* half-orc village (to be implemented yet) and
further, branching again into two miniscule parts - *Red River* heading
west and *White River* heading north, behind the *Glacial Waterfall*.

A secret door can be found west of the waterfall, with a path to the
*Widow's Peak*, where [Faceless Statue
Quest](Faceless_Statue_Quest "wikilink") can be initiated.

Two safe rooms exist with portable mobs; [Dirk
Chivers](Dirk_Chivers "wikilink") is at northern raft pier, while [Hiram
Chivers](Hiram_Chivers "wikilink") is at Moonbay's pier.

## Adventuring

Vast majority of the river is uncursed, scarcely filled with roaming
aggie and nonaggie fish and other water creatures, that can all be
hunted for modest XP. Several rooms allow for rest and respell (the
riverboats that can be entered when you see them - just enter them, and
exit anywhere to return to the same room), as well as "hidden" rooms
within the reeds, but those are water-based rooms and not really
suitable for prolonged sleep (without a boat in inventory).

**Note:** Area (currently) does not have a local cloud. Players will
respawn on the Eragora Walkways cloud instead.
