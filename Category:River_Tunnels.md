## Navigation

## Adventuring

This [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") is often only entered for
the [gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") in it, particularly the
[mushroom-shaped
amulet](Mushroom-Shaped_Amulet_(River_Tunnels).md "wikilink"), the
[red-eyed jewel](Red-Eyed_Jewel.md "wikilink"), and the [copper
bracelet](Copper_Bracelet.md "wikilink").

There are some mobs to be killed for exp, namely the goblins and the
blind fish.

n3ws from the entrance is the area where the myconoids are. They are
easy to kill and will [flee](Wimpy_Mobs.md "wikilink"), but they will
drop your [align](Alignment.md "wikilink"). At the end of the land is
the [myconoid shaman](Myconoid_Shaman.md "wikilink"), who has the very
useful [mushroom-shaped amulet](Mushroom-Shaped_Amulet.md "wikilink").
He's sanced but not incredibly difficult.

n5wsw from the entrance will lead you towards the [Dirty
Troll](Dirty_Troll "wikilink"). He's got a wield and hits HARD - be
careful killing him unspelled. If you manage to kill him, you can loot
his [glowing suit of banded
mail](Glowing_Suit_Of_Banded_Mail.md "wikilink") (+str on body gear),
and his wield.

n2w2n2w2n from the etrance will lead you towards the [Growling
Orc](Growling_Orc "wikilink"). He has the [copper
bracelet](Copper_Bracelet.md "wikilink") (wrist hit gear), and the
[red-eyed jewel](Red-Eyed_Jewel.md "wikilink") (held +2int gear) is down
from the orc. There are also various other not-so-useful gems in that
room, which can be sold at the [jeweller](Jeweller.md "wikilink") for a
bit of cash.

See each item's individual page for more-detailed information.
