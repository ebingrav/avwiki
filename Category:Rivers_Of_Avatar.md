*The rivers flow between various parts of the Realm, connecting them
smoothly. Rumor has it that one such river leads to the [house of
Quests](:Category:_House_Of_Quests.md "wikilink"), where the Questmaster
awaits with a prize for [Heroes](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") worthy
enough to defeat him. Unfortunately, nobody seems to know which river
this is.*

**Level Range:** 10-15
