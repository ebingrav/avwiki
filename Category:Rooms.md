Each AVATAR MUD [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") contains a
collection of individual rooms.

Each room may be of at least one special
[type](:Category:_Room_Types.md "wikilink"), has one specific
[terrain](:Category:_Terrains.md "wikilink"), and may have up to six
non-magical [exits](:Category:_Room_Exits.md "wikilink") to other rooms.

Note that individual rooms do not all have their own pages on this Wiki
yet, except for those of a few special
[types](:Category:_Room_Types.md "wikilink") (namely
[banks](:Category:_Banks.md "wikilink"), [donation
rooms](:Category:_Donation_Rooms.md "wikilink"),
[infirmaries](:Category:_Infirmaries.md "wikilink"), and [pet
shops](:Category:_Pet_Shops.md "wikilink")). See these categories for
lists of such rooms. Rooms that did get categorised can be found in
subcategories in their respective areas.
