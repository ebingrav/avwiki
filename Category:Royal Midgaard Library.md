*When [Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith "wikilink") and
[Werredan](Werredan "wikilink") decided to take over [the Temple of
Avatar](:Category:_Temple_Of_AVATAR "wikilink"), the King of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") was worried about what would
happen to the library that his people and loved and used for many years.
The High Priests were willing to compromise and gave the library and its
contents to the people of [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink").
They even gave the king a bit of funding to help with the rebuild. The
King set about not only remaking the library in his mind's image, but in
acquiring new and rare books and scrolls for researchers to use and his
people to cherish. Only problem is, he forgot to schedule the exorcism.*
