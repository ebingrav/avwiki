## Connections

## Navigation

The area is very small, and navigation is trivial. All rooms are cursed.

## Adventuring

Very few mobs are present here, the guards are worth about 85xp solo,
the lich perhaps double that. The area is unlikely to sustain a longer
run, so it's usually ran just for the [Great White Battle
Axe](Great_White_Battle_Axe "wikilink") quest.

A warning to those [BCI](:Category:Black_Circle_Initiates "wikilink")
(and [Berserkers](:Category:Berserkers "wikilink") as well) interested
in running this area - the entrance door is not pickable, and there is
no key. Losing [Pass Door](Pass_Door "wikilink") will leave you without
an exit.
