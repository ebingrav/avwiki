## Navigation

This Lair is small, only 15 rooms, and consists of a single layer, with
a southern and eastern branch stretching from the entrance. As with all
the ruined lairs, all rooms are cursed.

## Adventuring

Assuming you are here for the [Great White Battle Axe
Quest](Great_White_Battle_Axe_Quest "wikilink"), the Lich can be found
d, 3e, n from the first room. Otherwise, the area is scarcely populated
and can be cleared quickly.

A warning to those [BCI](:Category:Black_Circle_Initiates "wikilink")
(and [Berserkers](:Category:Berserkers "wikilink") as well) interested
in running this area - the entrance door is not pickable, and there is
no key. Losing [Pass Door](Pass_Door "wikilink") will leave you without
an exit.
