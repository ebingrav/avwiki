*In the past there was a plot to take over
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") itself. Fortunately the
plotters made a mistake and managed to ruin the plot themselves. The
ruins of the lairs they constructed might still contain something worth
finding. Rumors where they might be found are [floating in the
air](:Category:_Ruined_Lair_Introduction "wikilink")...*

**Level Range:** 51-51

**Builder:** Noltano

## Comments

This area is unique in that the entrance to it is separate from the
[mob](Ghostly_Spirit "wikilink") which you learn of the area from, as
well as it consists of the introductory room and 5 more completely
separate sub-areas. You can examine the [Ghostly
Spirit](Ghostly_Spirit "wikilink") to learn the background but the mob
does not represent the entrance to the zone.

One thing common to all the lairs is that all the rooms are cursed (with
one notable exception at Lair 3), and all lairs feature a large number
of hidden passageways - invisible walls that can only be discovered by
attempting to pass through them or by opening them. Thus, if you are
exploring these areas, try to walk in every direction irregardless of
the exits listed, in every room.

For more info on Lair locations and specifics, please consult the
subcategories listed below.
