## Navigation

The first room has two fountains - simply quaffing will transport you to
[Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"), whereas **quaff trickle** will transport
you to the area proper.

Once inside take heed of the rooms with secret exits and doors, so if
you are exploring the area for the first time, be sure to walk in all
directions in every new room.

The area is made of two parts - the upper layer with the wandering
guards, and the lower layer with the great laboratory, lots of steadfast
mobs and the wandering Lich.

In the center of the upper layer is a fountain, quaffing from it will
transport the player to [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"). This is the only
natural way out, aside for teleport or portal.

To the north of the lower layer is a locked door, at the other side of
which is an important ticket for the [Great White Battle Axe
Quest](Great_White_Battle_Axe_Quest "wikilink"). Consult this quest on
tips how to obtain the [Intricate Obsidian
Key](Intricate_Obsidian_Key "wikilink").

## Adventuring

As is usual with the Ruined Lair areas - the area is swarmy, with
unexpected walking by many undead mobs, so unless you are big, stay on
your toes and scan often. [Lich](Lich "wikilink") (68, sanc'd, casts)
wanders the lower layer and the [Huge Water
Wraith](Huge_Water_Wraith "wikilink") (90) is ... huge. Skin it and take
the skinned scale to [Wraith General](Wraith_General "wikilink") in
[Lair 3](:Category:Ruined_Lair_3_Of_5.md "wikilink") to get the key to
the ruined bedroom.

[Ghasts](Ghasts "wikilink") on lower level both have the weapon [Long
Blackened Chain](Long_Blackened_Chain "wikilink").

The top level has about a dozen ghostly warriors (race:
[ghost](Ghosts.md "wikilink")), four of whom are of the "large" variety
(level 69 instead of 63). In the center/fountain room there is also a
[ghostly cleric](Ghostly_Cleric.md "wikilink") (64).
