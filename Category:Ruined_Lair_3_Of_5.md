## Connections

-   [Morte Vallta](:Category:Morte_Vallta.md "wikilink")
    ([map](Morte_Vallta_Map.md "wikilink"))

## Navigation

Once you have navigated Morte Vallta to the entrance and the solitary
uncursed room (unique in that regards - all other rooms in all the lairs
are cursed), be sure to set recall, for later reference and potential CR
reasons.

-   The first layer is simple if not straightforward - two loops and
    some outlying rooms,
-   The maze part - an 8 room maze, thankfully empty of mobs,
-   The lower layer - a small 6-room part with the wandering Lich.

As with other lairs, many rooms have invisible doors (especially in the
maze), obfuscating further exploration routes. Be sure to attempt to
move in all directions irregardless of the obvious exits.

## Adventuring

This lair is the largest ruined lair of the five, and offers good
experience through large numbers of relatively weak but swarmy undead
mobs. Area spells are preferable method of dealing with these, as well
as an [arc shield](Charge_Shield.md "wikilink"), so the area is often
soloed by spellcasters, and an occasional priest (all undead, aggressive
mobs).

Dying deep inside the lair might present a difficulty as one is almost
guaranteed to get aggied multiple times along the way, so maintain your
recall point to help the CR-ers to get inside quickly.

If you are interested in the [Great White Battle Axe
Quest](Great_White_Battle_Axe_Quest "wikilink"), the Lich will be
wandering in the lower layer.
