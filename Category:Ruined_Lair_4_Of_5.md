## Navigation

This particular lair is very small - 5x2 block, almost fully
cross-connected.

## Adventuring

Only a few mobs reside here (about 5-6) and the Lich (whom you'll be
after if doing the [Great White Battle Axe
Quest](Great_White_Battle_Axe_Quest "wikilink")) is usually located in
the room 1s from entrance.

A warning to those [BCI](:Category:Black_Circle_Initiates "wikilink")
(and [Berserkers](:Category:Berserkers "wikilink") as well) interested
in running this area - the entrance door is not pickable, and there is
no key. Losing [Pass Door](Pass_Door "wikilink") will leave you without
an exit.
