*The High [Drow](Drow "wikilink") kept to themselves, consolidating
their power rather than expanding like their surface-dwelling cousins.
Legends say they built the greatest city ever known, the darkly
beautiful Reveria'Valsi, rumored to be over twice the size of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") and richer than a thousand
palaces. Somewhat xenophobic, they even exiled those born as modern
[drow](Drow "wikilink"), to the surface or into servitude to the
[Duergar](Duergar "wikilink"). Centuries later, High
[Drow](Drow "wikilink") society was divided in its allegiances in the
Second War of [Giants](Giants "wikilink") and [Ents](Ents "wikilink").
Fighting broke out among them, but they were never to resolve their
civil conflict, as the Armies of Evil destroyed the massive cavern,
burying Reveria entirely. Those who did not die immediately eventually
starved, or fell victim to unnamed monsters of the underworld, or went
mad and died screaming alone in the cavernous depths. With Reveria'Valsi
utterly lost and the High [Drow](Drow "wikilink") annihilated, their
descendants built a new city elsewhere underground. (The ruins are a
huge region comprised of [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") submitted
for the 3rd Annual [Area Building
Contest](Area-Building_Contests "wikilink").)*

## Navigation

This cave is a proper big maze. Really fun to explore and make sense of!
It is the walking connection of a lot of
[areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"), both
[hero](:Category:_Hero "wikilink") and
[lowmort](:Category:_Lowmort "wikilink"). In itself it is safe and due
to lack of [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") probably not worth
running, its danger lies in stumbling into some highly
[aggie](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")
[areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink").

## Adventuring

One way to make use of this area for running purposes is if you are
fighting alot in [Orkenhome](:Category:Orkenhome "wikilink"), and find
your alignment dropping, you can pop out and into the Ruins to find a
few wimpy scavangers to kill and raise your alignment back up, while
still getting a bit of xp.
