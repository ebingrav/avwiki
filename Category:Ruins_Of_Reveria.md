*The High [Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") kept to themselves, consolidating
their power rather than expanding like their surface-dwelling cousins.
Legends say they built the greatest city ever known, the darkly
beautiful Reveria'Valsi, rumored to be over twice the size of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink") and richer than a thousand
palaces. Somewhat xenophobic, they even exiled those born as modern
[drow](Drow.md "wikilink"), to the surface or into servitude to the
[Duergar](Duergar.md "wikilink"). Centuries later, High
[Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") society was divided in its allegiances in the
Second War of [Giants](Giants.md "wikilink") and
[Ents](Ents.md "wikilink"). Fighting broke out among them, but they were
never to resolve their civil conflict, as the Armies of Evil destroyed
the massive cavern, burying Reveria entirely. Those who did not die
immediately eventually starved, or fell victim to unnamed monsters of
the underworld, or went mad and died screaming alone in the cavernous
depths. With Reveria'Valsi utterly lost and the High
[Drow](Drow.md "wikilink") annihilated, their descendants built a new
city elsewhere underground. (The ruins are a huge region comprised of
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") submitted for the 3rd Annual
[Area Building Contest](Area-Building_Contests.md "wikilink").)*

## Navigation

This cave is a proper big maze. Really fun to explore and make sense of!
It is the walking connection of a lot of
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"), both
[hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") and
[lowmort](:Category:_Lowmort.md "wikilink"). In itself it is safe and
due to lack of [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") probably not worth
running, its danger lies in stumbling into some highly
[aggie](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink")
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink").

## Adventuring

One way to make use of this area for running purposes is if you are
fighting alot in [Orkenhome](:Category:Orkenhome.md "wikilink"), and
find your alignment dropping, you can pop out and into the Ruins to find
a few wimpy scavangers to kill and raise your alignment back up, while
still getting a bit of xp.
