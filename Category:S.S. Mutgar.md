*After many years under the tutelage of [Grunka the
Great](Great_Grunka "wikilink"), [Mutgar
Bonesnap](Captain_Mutgar "wikilink") decided that he was ready to
venture into the world. He spent many hours and all of his coin to
persuade other students that their time was done. "Come with me, and we
shall venture into the [Deep Blue
Sea](:Category:_Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes "wikilink")!" he exclaimed. After
many months and many failed attempts,
[Mutgar](Captain_Mutgar "wikilink") and his rag-tag bunch of adventurers
had assembled a nearly water worthy vessel on the banks of [Lake
Crystalmir](:Category:_Crystalmir_Lake "wikilink"). He launched his ship
and sailed into the sunset exlaiming his greatness over
[Grunka](Great_Grunka "wikilink"). With a grin that went from ear to
ear, [Grunka](Great_Grunka "wikilink") waved and erupted into laughter.
Thinking to himself [Grunka](Great_Grunka "wikilink") turned,
"[Ocean](:Category:_Sea_Of_Strayed_Hopes "wikilink") other way....".*

## Connections

This area is connected to [Lake
Crystalmir](:Category:_Crystalmir_Lake "wikilink").

## Navigation

The deck of the ship is the first level of the area that players come
up. There is a lower level of the ship, which contains a few secret
doors players may want to poke around for fun.

## Adventuring

There are a good number of mobs in this area, so it is a pretty nice
place for exp. Some of the mobs carry weapons, making them a bit
tougher, but it isn't a huge challenge. Especially fun are the sleeping
pirates found on the lower level. Since they are sleeping, players can
get off an especially strong hit to start with, making them nice
pickings for exp.

The main gear of note in this area is the
[hat](Captain_Mutgar's_Hat "wikilink") that [Captain
Mutgar](Captain_Mutgar "wikilink") wears. He's on the deck of the ship,
so he's fairly easy to find. See the map for more details.
