*Sages were a [class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") in development.
Work on them stalled because, in order to be viable, they necessitated
the completion of a massive Alchemy project. The original developer of
Alchemy is no longer with AVATAR, and none of the other developers will
ever have the time or energy to finish it. Without it, Sages are left
pretty empty handed. Thus, the decision has made to officially announce
Sages cancelled. They have blended with
[Wizards](:Category:_Wizards "wikilink") to help that
[class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") stand out more from their
[Mage](:Category:_Mages "wikilink") cousins.*
