*Little is known of this temple, other than its only entrance can be
found deep within a cave high in a mountain range. Observers have
reported seeing [gnome](Gnomes "wikilink") dragoons forcing people from
nearby villages into the temple under heavy guard -- the villagers were
never seen again.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

## Navigation

The area is miniature, only 16 rooms big, mostly forming a cursed-room
loop with some outlying rooms. The first two rooms are not cursed.

## Adventuring

If you are here, you are probably after the [Sword Of
Avengers](Sword_Of_Avengers "wikilink"), a fine hero piercer. It is
located on the same-named mob in a locked room north of [Archbishop
Morte](Archbishop_Morte "wikilink"), who has the key. Morte is a high
level sorcerer, so some caution is advised.

With some exceptions like said Morte, mobs will not see hidden players,
making the run easier. Rest of the mobs are smaller, but the Dragoon
Lieutenants will stab, and rooms are often packed with 4 or more mobs at
a time.
