*The Sarphyre line has loosely controlled the realm's population of
[Sprites](Sprites "wikilink") and their faerie ilk for centuries. Their
court has always roved throughout the forests of the world rather than
settling in any particular domain. The current Baron, [Amier
Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre "wikilink"), has changed this by building
an underground court to hide himself from the threat of the harpies of
[Lloth's peak](:Category:_Lloth's_Peak "wikilink").*

**Level Range:** 10-15
