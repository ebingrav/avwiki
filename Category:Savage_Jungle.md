*Deep within the homeworld of the kzinti race lies a dense jungle, thick
with lush vegetation and hidden danger. The jungle lies in the Valley of
the Spires, and it must be navigated if one wishes to reach the great
Kzinti Spires.*

**Builder:** Copycat, Ctibor

## Directions

-   c planeshift kzinti

## Connections

-   [Shunned World](:Category:Shunned_World "wikilink")
    ([map](Shunned_World_Map "wikilink")) - from shift go 7w.
-   [Inferno Peak](:Category:Inferno_Peak "wikilink")
    ([map](Inferno_Peak_Map "wikilink")) - from shift go e, 3s, 2u.
-   [Spire Of War](:Category:Kzinti_Spire_Of_War "wikilink")
    ([map](Kzinti_Spire_Of_War_Map "wikilink")), which houses the

## Navigation

It's a huge mesh. See the map for a detailed layout. There is a
two-room-wide passage north, towards the 6-room portal chamber, just
south of which there is a link eastwards towards 6 rooms preceding Spire
of War.

## Adventuring

A solo-friendly area (once you pass the shift) that has various medium-
and small-sized mobs, notably Kzinti citizens, patrollers, and lizards,
etc. Not worth much xp and mostly consisting of empty rooms.

For [Ant Antenna](Ant_Antenna "wikilink") or [Ant
Chakram](Ant_Chakram "wikilink"), head 6e, n from shift. North will be a
room full of ants. Clear enough of them and then a queen spawns. Skin
queen corpse for antenna or chakram depending on which queen spawned.
