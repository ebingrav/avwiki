*The shrine near the [ruins of
Reveria](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria.md "wikilink") was built in the
time of the High [Drow](Drow.md "wikilink"), and had originally been a
place of worship, but soon became a place where outcast
[drow](Drow.md "wikilink"), known as veldri, fled from their kin and
mysteriously vanished. Recently, reports of creatures of stone moving in
the shrine have been cited. [King Domi](King_Domi.md "wikilink") has
ordered a thorough investigation of this area, seeking to rid the place
of magic.*
