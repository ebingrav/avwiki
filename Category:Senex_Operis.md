*Recent explorations done by
[Midgaard](:Category:Midgaard.md "wikilink")'s surveyors have uncovered
an ancient ruin nestled in the forest to the southwest of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink"). After several surveyors
were murdered within an intact portion of the main ruin, the King
ordered an investigation of the area. When word came back from the
oracles that it had been infested by a necromancer, he ordered a guard
set up at the ruin to protect against the evil within.*

**Level Range:** 18-25
