*In the vast mountain range north of the
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink"), there stands an ominous
tower. The outside has been reported to have actual scales covering it,
and the top of the structure is designed like the head of a serpent.
Within the halls of this weyr are a clan of
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") serpent demon worshippers. It
is said that not only do they have a clan of hill
[giants](Giants "wikilink") under their thrall, but they have several
types of reptilian creatures in their midst.*

## Connections

    ([map](Battleground_Map "wikilink"))

## Navigation

The area has several logical parts:

-   The cave system that connects to the hill giant hall to the west
    (which is a 3x3 area), and Serpent Weyr ground floor to the east,
-   Serp. Weyr ground floor - a set of empty cells and the witch at the
    end,
-   Serp. Wery military floor - some easy warrior mobs, watch out for
    the war room (3 aggie mobs),
-   Serp. Weyr sorcery floor - a solitary sorcerer and his pet demon,
-   Serp. Weyr noble floor - three aggressive mobs/bosses, the king has
    the [grand serpent hood](Grand_Serpent_Hood "wikilink"),
-   Serp. Weyr top floor - three dragons (each breathes different
    spittle) in pens and a rider.

## Adventuring

This is a rather smallish area with generally small mobs that are
appropriate for lowhero casters to solo, or small (also lowhero) brutish
duos to run through. The experience is low-to-average, even when
soloing, and the gear is lackluster nowadays, save for the [grand
serpent hood](Grand_Serpent_Hood "wikilink") on King Ka'plar, a fine
hero mana head-piece.

To enter the Serpent Weyr proper you will need a key, which can usually
be looted from the Hill Giant King's dead body. In the Weyr itself, the
mob difficulty will rise with the floors, but all these can be soloed by
a single 101 caster, so don't be overly frightened to mass murder the
entire Weyr. The dragons on the top floor will have a nasty habit of
tailing, so if you are a caster you may want to avoid these, unless you
are certain you can survive 15ish seconds of lag while they breathe
electricity or acid on you.

The biggest mob is King Ka'plar (who is also in sanctuary, and is
portable, should you only require his head with the head-piece), but two
or three surge 3 disintegrates will drop him easily.

Overall, this is a nice and easy-going exploration-based area that
doesn't feature quests and is a good test for your small lowheroes if
you are bored with the regular areas.
