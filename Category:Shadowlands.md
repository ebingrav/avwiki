*Many aspects of the netherworld touch the material planes, the barriers
weakened by those who have passed beyond and even more so by those who
have managed to find their way back. It is possible for the living to
venture past these weak spots if they are willing to give up a bit of
themselves to make the journey.*

## Navigation

this involves first going through a hero tier area and triggering a path
into the (lord tier) area proper.

## Adventuring

The key attraction of this area is a run which yields 10,000 xp when
done fully, but which only yields the big xp bonus after a reboot or a
"pool reset".

The run is like this:

-   Check your group's stats in Midgaardia (you should be at full
    hp/mana in shadow form as well as regular form).
-   Shift to Astral, then visit the lich queen.
-   From lich queen: down, south. Have each group member type "die" in
    this room (where the barrier between worlds is thin). Only one
    groupie is triggered at a time, so they may need to try to 'die'
    more than once.
-   You're now in the Shadowlands area proper and you're in shadow form
    with Midgaardia style shadowed-lord stats. This is a 4x4x4 cube; on
    each level, the west side has 'up' exits which go up a level and
    'down' exits which go down a level. The levels wrap around, so on
    the 1st layer, the west up exits go to the 2nd layer, while the east
    down exits go to the 4th layer.
-   There are 5 important mobs to kill. Each level has one mob you need
    to kill: shade of an executioner, shade of an ent, murky merman and
    preta. One level also has a special 'down, down' exit that goes to a
    room containing Ketos, a kraken-like creature that you have to kill
    multiple times (keep killing Ketos until no more spawn). These mobs
    are reboot/reset only and groupmates need to be in the room when the
    mob dies to get a xp bonus later.
-   Each level also has one room where you need to 'forage'. The forage
    command will sometimes drop a special item on the ground; be sure
    you get at least one of: snail, goo, grubs, fruit. (Ask someone who
    has done the run dozens of times and they should be able to point
    you to the correct forage room on each level.)
-   While you go through the area killing the 5 boss mobs and collecting
    the 4 forage items, you'll also run across "tsalmaveth" mobs. When a
    tsalmaveth dies, it drops a piece of shadow. Kill enough tsalmaveths
    that you have at least 1 piece of shadow per member of the group
    (these items are type "key", so you can't save them across reboots;
    collecting extras isn't super important. 1-2 extra is enough in case
    someone makes a mistake). If you don't have enough, wander the area
    until you kill more tsalmaveths.

The forage rooms are (type where to see at which layer you are):

-   1st level (City of Shadow): w w n from executioner
-   2nd level (Under the Shrouded Canopy): s s s from shade ent
-   3rd level (Gray Waters): e s s s from merman
-   4th level (Lack of Shade): w w from preta

Once you have:

-   killed all 5 boss mobs (shade of executioner, ent shade, hulky
    merman, preta, Ketos)
-   collected all 4 forage items (snail, goo, grubs, fruit)
-   collected enough pieces of shadow for each groupmate

then you can go to see Djehuti. He's accessed via a special "up, up"
exit on one level near the northwest corner (go all north, all west,
then east, south, up, up). In his room you should:

-   get bowl, give bowl Dj -- he will give you a shadow sash. Give sash
    Dj -- he will give you shadow boots

Then make sure each groupmate has a piece of Shadow. Starting with a
tank, instruct each group member to:

-   give piece Dj, (wait for him to give you a shroud), wear shroud,
    enter vortex, east, east.

If you do this properly you'll end up with non-shadowed stats in the
room 2e, which is called "Piercing the veil". Now you are non-shadowed
and you're in a small "trial of fire" subarea full of lemures. Kill all
the lemures in this subarea. When all the lemures are dead, a door to
the east will open.

Regenerate if needed, then send a tank east and kill the 3 large mobs
there (Sekhmet, Ammit, and Babi). Once all three are dead, go east. Type
"die" to earn your 10000 xp reward (assuming you were present for the
deaths of all 5 shadowed boss mobs; each boss provides for a certain
amount of xp) and be transported back to a safe room in Astral (Facing
Reality).

The leader should be the last to type "die" since they'll earn
leadership points for their groupmates who earn levels in the room.

From "Facing Reality" it is traditional to send a tank east to kill Lord
Gith and the malevolence. From there, end the run as you like -- it's
popular to portal to 'night hag', kill the hag then homeshift.
