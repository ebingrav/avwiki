## Adventuring

Better known as yaks, while this is a [hero
area](:Category:_Hero_Areas "wikilink"), it is seldom run because most
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") will
[assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink") after [level](Level "wikilink") 49.
It is ideal for high lowmort, as a
[warrior](:Category:_Warriors "wikilink")/[monk](:Category:_Monks "wikilink")
with decent ac could easily tank this area starting as low as
[level](Level "wikilink") 35.

Most common pp is [yaksha priest](Robed_Yaksha_Priest "wikilink"), which
takes you to "Before a Ceremony". In this room, drinking from the
fountain of blood will give you lowmort [giant
strength](Giant_Strength "wikilink"). South of this room are the
yakshas, farther south the calchonas, and north the coblynau.

The yakshas are pretty wimpy for hero mobs; they flee easy and don't
assist (until 50+) - although the servants sometimes assist at lower
levels. Also, they are evil, so they won't hurt your good
[alignment](Alignment "wikilink"). The human servants are a little bit
lower level than the yakshas, and a little bit easier. Down from the
main floor is another area where more yakshas are; down from the bathing
area is a hiding giant turtle which carries the [encrusted layer of
empty shells](Encrusted_Layer_Of_Empty_Shells "wikilink") (a
[hero](:Category:_Hero "wikilink")-tier
[container](:Category:_Containers "wikilink")). Remember to have [water
breathing](Water_Breathing "wikilink") cast on you if you wish to fight
it, and be forewarned that it is significantly bigger than the other
mobs.

The calchonas (strange white dog on scan) load in the "Dark black
tunnel" and "Twilight" rooms south of the yaks. Sometimes yaks
wander/flee this far back: be wary of fighting them as the calchonas are
hidden and will [assist](assist "wikilink") at a lower level than 50.
Travelling farther south will take you into the connecting area, [Valley
of the Sun](:Category:_Valley_Of_The_Sun "wikilink").

North and west of the fountain are the coblynau; they are of similar
difficulty as the yaks, and will also flee easily. They are good
aligned, however, so watch your [alignment](Alignment "wikilink") if you
kill more than one repop of them. Also, be careful not to accidentally
attack the foreman: he is considerably tougher. (Also, his wield is used
as a key to the crack in one of the yakinshi rooms.)

North and down from the fountain takes you to the final part of the
area, with the guards. The awake guard hits considerably harder than the
sleeping one, and sometimes assists, so usually they are skipped. If you
want to get inside the vault, you'll have to kill the sleeping guard,
find what his key unlocks in the area, wait for the sleeping guard to
repop, give him the contents of the chest, and then he'll get you the
amethyst key needed to go north. Inside the vault is Sulphani with gold,
and a much tougher mob with a hero wield.
