*Rumor has it the Dark Fae have devised a mechanism to trap those who
visit them uninvited. Details from survivors are sketchy, but escape
back to their homes does seem to be possible for those who can endure
the assaults of the Watchmen. Whether or not there is a way to elude the
Shiftwatch Orb and set foot in Noctopia itself is unknown.*

## Directions

[Planeshift](Planeshift "wikilink") to
[Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia "wikilink")

## Connections

s, d, w, \[d\] from shift will take you to a
[Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink") room in [Under The
Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars "wikilink").

## Navigation

Other than the way out, we haven't found much of interest in this area
yet.

## Adventuring

To survive shift, you need 5-6 mains (sometimes it gets swarmy..5-6 mobs
with snipers that deal 1k surrounding shift) Shift mobs are between
level 170 and 185(Soulstealer and Sentinel respectively). Most mobs have
a wield and or offhand in Shiftwatch and hit for about
annihilate/eradicate (except for the snipers which hit mangle). To
survive shift, have the tanks plane at same time, and make the casters
plane \~10 seconds afterwards.

If you have a bld or two with veil of blades, the shift is much easier.
