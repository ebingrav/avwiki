*Far, far to the northwest, on the other side of Tiamat's Teeth, there
is a walled city in a desert Valley called [the Valley of the
Sun](:Category:_Valley_Of_The_Sun.md "wikilink"). Little is known about
it. In fact, the only rumors anyone has heard of the place is that the
Shogun sent an emissary to ask for the aid of the King of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink") with a message begging for
assistance dealing with a rogue band of Ronin.*

## Adventuring

Watch out for [Merchant Lord
Denbosai](Merchant_Lord_Denbosai "wikilink") (85), he is tough (hits
hard & sanc'd) and casts a nasty disintegrate. He is hanging out with
his buddy [The Privateer Captain](The_Privateer_Captain "wikilink") (75)
a little east of the entrance to the city in the Community Room in the
Merchants House. Both are aggie.
