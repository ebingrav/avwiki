*Teetering on the edge of the great plane of Karnath lies the sphinx of
Fluent the Wise. Long had it stood, a beacon for Fluent's followers and
a safehaven for the weak. All that has changed with the great Cataclysm.
Now the sphinx lies in disrepair, its once-safe halls now fraught with
lawlessness and corruption.*

*To escape the turmoil and chaos, Fluent has isolated himself and his
key advisors as they attempt to restore some semblance of balance to
this now-crazy world.*

*It is said that Aziz-Ra, believing that he and Fluent were working to
the same end, sent a messenger to Fluent but he never arrived. Now the
two factions struggle in isolation, neither trusting the other and
neither making much progress in restoring the tranquility of this land.*
