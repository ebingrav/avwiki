*The Silmavar is a colossal underground series of caves, caverns,
tunnels and ruins. Its origin and purpose are completely unknown, even
to the myriad creatures that make their home there. Legends speak of a
conclave of crazed [humans](Humans.md "wikilink"), lead by their king,
[Saeren](Saeren_The_King.md "wikilink"), and of hordes of
[undead](Undead_Mobs.md "wikilink") in the thrall of the great Lich,
[Numenor](Numenor_The_Lich.md "wikilink"), and of
[goblins](Goblins.md "wikilink") and balrogs and lakes of fire and
magma. Some even speak in hushed whispers of a small group of ancient
[dragons](Dragons.md "wikilink") guarding some of the labyrinth's oldest
ruins. Silmavar is a place of many wonders, and very few have seen all
of them.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

**Builder:** Draeger

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink"): 16e, \[e\], s, \[d\],
w.

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Numenor](Numenor_The_Lich.md "wikilink") (warning:
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink")).

## Connections

-   [ Wildwood](:Category:Wildwood.md "wikilink")
    ([map](Wildwood_Map.md "wikilink")) - inbound only

## Navigation

The area has three layers:

-   Top layer, containing [Numenor](Numenor_The_Lich.md "wikilink") and
    his undead, a mostly straightforward set of circular passageways,
-   Second layer, with the human, goblin and spider kingdoms, an
    essentially straight path that only sidetracks into the spider
    domain and has off-shooting minor rooms depicting the kingdoms,
-   Bottom layer, the domain of dragons, balrogs and elementals, an even
    more straightforward path with some off-shooting rooms.

Area is almost completely cursed, with a few *Secret rooms* that are
uncursed and allow for recalling out. Aside for two minor private rooms
on the first layer, there are no extraordinary rooms worth mentioning,
aside for the randomized maze on the second layer, which is usually best
avoided.

## Adventuring

Apart from the wandering, [invisible](invis.md "wikilink") and
[aggressive](aggressive "wikilink") spectre on the top layer (aggressive
even towards [Move Hidden](Move_Hidden "wikilink") players), this area
is quite easy to run in, with just a few roaming agressive mobs on the
very bottom of the area.

First you are most likely to enter
[Numenors](Numenor_The_Lich.md "wikilink") room (portable), from here
you venture to the west. North from there you will find a water location
with bats and lurkers which tend to flee. In here you will also discover
a key in a chest which is needed later, if you do not want to or cannot
cast [Pass Door](Pass_Door "wikilink") on yourself.

To the south you will encounter two guardians, who both wield and
therefore can be a bit hurtful to fight. From the guardians you can walk
to the east, where you will find skeletons (wimpy) and [dread
knights](Dread_Knight.md "wikilink") (carrying [Jeweled
Scabbard](Jeweled_Scabbard "wikilink"), worn on waist). To the furthest
east you will find a locked door, this door can be opened with the key
from the river location with the lurkers and bats. Here you can descend
to the second layer.

At the beginning of the second layer you will find a few good-aligned
citizens, and here also are [Saeren The
King](Saeren_The_King "wikilink") (carries [Helm Of
Cherubims](Helm_Of_Cherubims "wikilink"), hit gear for head) and
[Raegard](Raegard "wikilink") (has a [Bottle Of
Cordial](Bottle_Of_Cordial "wikilink") stashed on the floor of the
secret room to his east).

After venturing further to the east, you will enter a room where the
door to the east is locked. The key for this door can be found on either
the mob to the south of this room
([Andrinia](Andrinia_The_Guard.md "wikilink")), or the guard to the
north ([Bondunor](Bondunor_The_Guard.md "wikilink")). After passing this
door you will find yourself in a section which hosts evil-aligned
goblins.

Heading south of the goblins you will encounter
[Grugnash](Grugnash_The_Guard.md "wikilink"), and from here you can
either go west and south to an area with spiders (which flee and
poison), and contains a mini maze with randomized room exits which can
be avoided, ([Spider queen](Shhshuk_The_Queen_Spider.md "wikilink") has
a poison) or east and then down to the third layer.

There are two un-cursed hidden rooms near the bottom of the staircase
([a shimmering emerald vial](Shimmering_Emerald_Vial.md "wikilink")
loads on the floor of one). The path to
[Kalimindroph](Kalimindroph "wikilink") (has [Bow Of
Aranor](Bow_Of_Aranor "wikilink")) is fairly straight to the west. If
you venture further west you might find yourself facing
[Balrogs](Warrior_Balrog.md "wikilink") as well, which are aggressive.
In with the Balrogs you might also find [Ral](Ral "wikilink") (has
[Maelstrom, Sword Of The
Balrog](Maelstrom,_Sword_Of_The_Balrog "wikilink")) and he is quite big
and hard to kill, though thankfully in his own room. He is significantly
bigger than the other mobs in this area.

At the very end of the third layer is an un-cursed room, which is a good
place to set recall.

This area also contains a heat source of exceptional power, that some
might casters might find useful for a certain [
spell](reforge.md "wikilink").
