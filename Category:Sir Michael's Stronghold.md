*These are dark times for the inhabitants of the stronghold that lies
deep within the dark stretches of
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink"). The commander, Sir Michael,
has put all his guards and knights on a hard training schedule. They
practice to prepare for the next attack in the wave of brutal battles
launched by the forces that besiege the enclave. The situation grows
more tense every day; scouts are reported to have infiltrated the grim
battlefields outside the enclave's walls. Still, most of the inhabitants
try to keep their minds clear of the coming danger. Monks mumble their
prayers. Peasants stroll lazily through the streets. And who could
really believe the end is so near when the famous Screaming Hippogriff
Inn is still standing? A few hours of card games, dice, and music, mixed
with good, cheap drinks renowned throughout the land, make the
forgetting even easier...*

**Level Range:** 51-51

## Navigation

## Adventuring

An extremely popular place to run as a soloing
[mage](:Category:Mages "wikilink") or with lowhero group. Within the
gates the mobs (save two) are non-[aggie](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")
and relatively easy to kill. The
[peasants](Wandering_Peasant "wikilink") and the bum are the best ones
to go for. JaRec, the Blacksmith and the Shaman are a little bigger.
Sharana is nice xp but sanced. [Bain](Bain "wikilink") and [Sir
Michael](Sir_Michael "wikilink") are significantly bigger. Also, Sir
Michael has a key for [Saul](Saul "wikilink"), another sanced mob worth
decent xp. The monks are a little tougher to kill due to being
[sanced](Sanctuary "wikilink") and thus give more XP than the peasants.
Outside the gates the mobs are all aggie and can see invisible, detect
sneak/move hidden so if you run there be sure to
[rescue](Rescue "wikilink"). There is a start of a quest(?) looking for
Ignos when you give [Horinos](Horinos "wikilink") a ticket when he
references the [Obelische
Caverns](:Category:Obelische_Caverns "wikilink") area.

Things to note are peasants and most of the gatekeepers assist after a
certain level so best to kill mobs that are in rooms on their own.

Overall, it's ideal for 40-51 solo casters or duos/trios if non-casting.
Virtually no heroes run it, due to the sparse mob population and low xp.
