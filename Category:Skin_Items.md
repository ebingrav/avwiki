"Skin items" are special objects obtained from certain mobs, not by
taking their equipment or inventory but rather by skinning their
corpses. To do this, characters must practice Skin Corpse, wield a Bowie
knife, use the skin command, and have an empty corpse of the appropriate
mob either in their inventory or on the ground in their room.

Determining which mobs' corpses will yield special "skin items"
beforehand is impossible. Most mob corpses, like all character corpses,
when skinned, will yield either generic skin bags (usually) or other
"junk" items like coats or belts (rarely), all named after whatever they
were made from, or perhaps nothing but a "bloody mess," depending on
luck. Only a few select mobs will yield special items, instead, like
those listed below.

Note that, at present, only archers and fusiliers may practice Skin
Corpse to produce these items.
