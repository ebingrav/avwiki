*While many Archers are free-roaming individualists communing with
nature and not above hugging the occasional tree, some of the more
populous races put those talents to work in a more disciplined, rigid,
military capacity. Soldiers lose out on some of the
[Archer's](:Category:Archers "wikilink") wilderness survival skills,
being mostly trained to defend castles and other developed areas, but
gain some unique new ones in return. Their discipline makes them skilled
leaders, and they can even impart some of their skills to other
group-mates. Many races train their soldiers with [crossbows instead of
bows](:Category:Missile_Weapons "wikilink"). Like all Prestige Classes,
they retain the original class's [Prime
Requisite](Prime_Requisite "wikilink"), in this case,
[Dexterity](Dexterity "wikilink").*

*Soldiers are far too law-abiding to ever become
[Assassins](:Category:Assassins "wikilink"), but occasionally, that
fervor for law leads them to trade their crossbows for great swords and
become [Paladins](:Category:Paladins "wikilink"), albeit at a higher
level than [Warriors](:Category:Warriors "wikilink").*

**Abbreviation:** Sld.

## Soldiers in General

## Soldier Creation

Requirements:

-   Level 50 Archer
-   base con of 14 (13 with devotion needs tested)
-   practice lead party
-   Prove your worth to Snapdragon in the form of socials
-   Character description must be blank.

elf: Sergeant Snapdragon says 'Your race has a glorious military
history... but it's just that. History.'

Hob: Sergeant Snapdragon exclaims 'Oh wow. Look at you! Big fancy race,
huh? Gotta be something special, huh? Well, life as a Soldier ain't for
you, precious!'

hel: Sergeant Snapdragon says 'You think you're tough enough? Well, I
don't, cadet! Now drop and gimme... no, you know what? Go make me a
doily. That seems more your speed.'

Gar: Sergeant Snapdragon says 'Sure, your race might fight. But can you
fight as a unit?'

-- The doily comment indicates a lack of con. SLDs need a lowmort base
con of 14 (13 with devotion needs to be tested) in order to pass this
step. This likely means available creatable races are DUE, DWF, HOR,
KZN, LIZ, ORC, TRG, OGR, GIA, DRC. Snapdragon does deny certain races
(even with 14 base con...like CEN and GAR), so this list likely
encompasses some that she will deny (I assume ENT would be
denied...someone make an archer ENT and confirm please). CONFIRMED
RACES: HOR, LIZ, ORC, DWF

Confirmed fails: Trl, Mir, Hie, Dsd, Min, Tua, Ign, Hob, Gar, Grf

## Soldiers at Hero Tier

### Training

Train attributes in the usual order for non-casters: wisdom,
constitution, and then intelligence. You can leave strength (which will
give a HR bonus) and dexterity (AC bonus) for later.

### Practicing

Practice all the important skills first: transportation spells,
sanctuary/frenzy, pass door, fly, water breathing, cure spells, sneak,
move hidden, dodge.

### Devoting

Worship and devotion choices are identical to archers (to be confirmed).

See: [Archer Worship](:Category:Archers#Worshipping "wikilink") and
[Archer Devoting](:Category:Archers#Devoting "wikilink") for more
information.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** TBD

**Tanking:** TBD

**Hitting:** TBD

**Healing:** TBD.

### Soldiers and UD

One more thing to keep in mind is that unlike archers, soldiers cannot
skin the Ultimate Dragon for [Ultimate Archer's
Gauntlet](Ultimate_Archer's_Gauntlet "wikilink").

If you are intent on getting this important piece of archer gear, only
two options are available:

-   use a regular archer to defeat UD and skin the gauntlet, then remort
    and become a solider,
-   defeat UD as a creatable archer and then descend and become a
    soldier - solution for remaining chosen race.
