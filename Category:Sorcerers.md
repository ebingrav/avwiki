*Think of power. Think of domination. Think of accomplishing these
things with blood, pain, and consorting with demons. Like to dabble in
the undead? Sorcery is for you, then. Only the most greedy and black
hearted souls walk down the Path of Sorcery, but that's just how they
like it.*

*Their Prime Statistic is Intelligence, giving them an advantage in
regards to knowledge and magic. Sorcery is a highly specialized field,
however, so they will never be said to be good at wielding a sword.*

**Abbreviation:** Sor.

## Sorcerers in General

Sorcerers are comparable to wizards in terms of hp and mana gains; they
recieve much more mana but also much less (around half) the hp than a
mage. Sorcerers specialize in single-target spells and don't gain many
area-damage spells. Akin to wizards, sorcerers receive very little of
the melee-related skills, so they rely purely on spell damage. They also
lose out on some protective spells, the most important of which are
[sanctuary](sanctuary "wikilink"), as well as the entire
[awen](Awen "wikilink") stack.

There are various utility spells to help them survive:
[Flash](Flash "wikilink"), [Vampire Touch](Vampire_Touch "wikilink"),
[Tainted Genius](Tainted_Genius "wikilink") and [Death
Shroud](Death_Shroud "wikilink") are the most important of them.
However, for learning many of their spells, they have to practice
[demonic intent](Demonic_Intent "wikilink"), which makes their alignment
irrevocably evil. This has a few major side-effects:

1.  They will not be able to receive [Awen](Awen "wikilink") from nor
    cast [Frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink") on good aligned party members,
2.  They cannot wear good-aligned enchanted gear without
    [violating](Violation "wikilink") it first (a process that rises
    item level) or [harmonising](Harmonize "wikilink") it with an evil
    cleric/druid.
3.  They make use of [Protection Good](Protection_Good "wikilink")
    instead of [Protection Evil](Protection_Evil "wikilink"), so they
    are more vulnerable to evil mobs than good-aligned characters.

They do, however possess an array of defensive spells/skills that render
their battles easier than a Wizard or Mage. One of these it is
[unrest](Unrest "wikilink"), which can be cast mid-battle and
drastically lowers an enemy's ability to regenerate hit points, opening
up the possibility of taking down enormous hero mobs such as the
horsemen of apocalypse and The Pretender. Their flash is also in-class,
unlike Wizard, which reduces the lag from about 10 seconds to 4-5
(depending on worship). If fleeing from a fight, the [Cloak Of
Pain](Cloak_Of_Pain "wikilink") skill generally allows them to flee
without being followed by the enraged mobs they were fighting.

Overall, sorcerers are usually less useful than mages and wizards at
hero tier in the context of grouping but are very powerful at lord tier,
where they typically have twice the mana of a mage and much better spell
damage (in fact, the highest spell damage period). However, due to the
inability to sanc themselves, sorcerers must hoard sanctuary-furnishing
items or run with someone who can sanc them. In addition, their lower hp
rolls make soloing (particularly lord shifts) difficult and therefore
they are less efficient at soloing than a large mage with a
magically-inclined race at this higher tier. Like all other classes
except mage, their shield charges do fail about 50% of the time, and
they do not get charged shield.

## Sorcerer Creation

Only [Mages](:Category:_Mages "wikilink"),
[Psionicists](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink"),
[Rippers](:Category:_Rippers "wikilink") and
[Mindbenders](:Category:_Mindbenders "wikilink") can become a Sorcerer.
It is a [remort](remort "wikilink") class that is only available at Lord
level 100 (to become a Human Sorcerer) or Lord level 200 to maintain the
current race for Mages and Mindbenders, and levels 150/300 for
Psionicists. Various [rebirth](Rebirth "wikilink") options also exist.
It is also now possible to remort to a createable race at Lord 125 if
you are already a Sorcerer.

## Sorcerers at Lowmort Tier

### Training

Similar to a [mage](:Category:_Mages "wikilink"), a new sorcerer's first
priority should be to train [wis](Wisdom "wikilink"),
[int](Intelligence "wikilink"), and [con](Constitution "wikilink").

To sorcerers [Dex](Dexterity "wikilink") is only useful for the
[AC](Armor_Class "wikilink") bonus, and [str](Strength "wikilink") for
carry capacity.

### Practicing

Skills critical to a sorcerer, especially if soloing or tanking are:

-   [Leech](Leech "wikilink") and later [Vampire
    touch](Vampire_Touch "wikilink") - to maintain health while doing
    damage,
-   [Flash](Flash "wikilink") - to blind mobs (thus reducing their HR),
-   [Tainted Genius](Tainted_Genius "wikilink") - to occasionally
    receive a great boost in XP gain,
-   [Death Shroud](Death_Shroud "wikilink") - to greatly reduce XP loss
    upon death.

Depending on gameplay style, some sorcerers delay practicing [Demonic
Intent](Demonic_Intent "wikilink") (and all related skills/spells) until
Hero 101, so they can use regular gear and benefit from [Protection
Evil](Protection_Evil "wikilink").

### Worshipping

Similarly to mages and wizards, popular deities at hero are
[Shizaga](Shizaga "wikilink") and [Quixoltan](Quixoltan "wikilink").
Quixoltan is even more common among sorcerers at hero tier due to their
inherently low HP gains, which benefit greatly from Qxl worship.

At lord, [Bhyss](Bhyss "wikilink") is popular, due to large damage bonus
it provides (which overshadows the flaws of worshipping Bhyss).

See the [mage worship section](:Category:Mages#Worshipping "wikilink")
for more information.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Same as any other caster - sorcerers rely on two sets of
gear, mana and tank, and gear aliases to switch them before combat.
During combat a lowmort sorcerer uses [Leech](Leech "wikilink") and
[Vampire Touch](Vampire_Touch "wikilink"), and will also benefit from a
charged shield.

**Tanking:** Sorcerers make poor tanks since they cannot rescue group
mates. They also do not learn [dodge](Dodge "wikilink") until hero, and
they never learn [shield block](Shield_Block "wikilink") nor
[parry](Parry "wikilink").

**Hitting:** Sorcerer melee is, similar to wizards, marginal.

**Healing:** Outside of healing self through life-leaching spells,
sorcerers are not in the healing business.

## Sorcerer Prestige Options

There are none.

## Sorcerers at Hero Tier

### Training

Identical to lowmort, see above.

### Practicing

Until hero level 101, [Vampire Touch](Vampire_Touch "wikilink") is the
primary offensive spell, replaced at that point with
[Torment](Torment "wikilink"). Other useful spells are:

-   [Immolation](Immolation "wikilink") - upon immolating a lowmort mob
    (up to lvl 26), sorcerers receive a short boost in damage
-   [Defiled Flesh](Defiled_Flesh "wikilink") - grants a significant
    boost (500 at hero, 1500 at lord) in hp for a short duration, but
    when active all healing is halved.

Other spells and skills like [Sphere Of
Silence](Sphere_Of_Silence "wikilink"), [Pillar Of
Flame](Pillar_Of_Flame "wikilink"), [Funeral
Lore](Funeral_Lore "wikilink"), [Cloak Of
Pain](Cloak_Of_Pain "wikilink") are of dubious usefulness or downright
useless.

### Devoting

Identical to other casters. See [devoting as a
mage](:Category:Mages#Devoting "wikilink") for more information.

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Sorcerers solo well, and can continue to do so in selected
lord areas (though not without risk, particularly if handling shifts
alone). A charged shield helps immensely, even without shield block
(particularly at low hero). Remember to get the shield to level 54 for
the best effect. While lord mobs are of course susceptible to the
significant damage associated with surged brimstone, they are less
affected by spells such as flash or unrest than hero mobs, and can
generally hit hard even through full ac and spells. Accordingly, the
best route for a Lord sor to get experience is a duo or a small group
with larger groupies, or conventional bigger-sized grouping.

Since sorcerers are universally evil after 101, soloing in good-aligned
areas is preferred where they can benefit from their [Protection
Good](Protection_Good "wikilink") spell. Some examples are:

-   Low Hero: [Greed's Gallows](:Category:Greed's_Gallows "wikilink") -
    the upper level is exclusively good,
-   Super Hero: [Rhuien Forest](:Category:Rhuien_Forest "wikilink") -
    all mobs are saintly, but it requires self-spelling.

**Tanking:** Sorcerers with enchanted AC gear make acceptable tanks,
however they lack [rescue](rescue "wikilink"). This makes it nice to
have a large group mate to rescue other groupies. They also lack [shield
block](Shield_Block "wikilink") and [parry](Parry "wikilink"). While
tanking, their [dodge](Dodge "wikilink"), [Vampire
Touch](Vampire_Touch "wikilink") and in-class [Flash](Flash "wikilink")
all directly and significantly help. As always, a charged shield grants
further assistance.

**Hitting:** Sorcerers, like wizards, are bereft of the hitting skills
mages receive. Therefore, they do not make for even mediocre melee
hitters. However, as [hitters](hitters "wikilink") is defined in the
in-game help files ("The role of the hitter(s) in the group is to
inflict damage onto the mob"), as long as a Sorcerer has sufficient
mana, they should be able to cause significant damage casting
[torment](torment "wikilink").

**Healing:** As any caster, sorcerers can brandish or zap healing staves
and wands, some of which need to be violated prior to use. Otherwise,
they lack any healing spells. While they do not get [cure
poison](Cure_Poison "wikilink") they do get (the psi equivalent) [cell
adjustment](Cell_Adjustment "wikilink"); although they never get [bio
empathy](bio_empathy "wikilink"), so can only cast it on themselves.
They also have in-class [remove curse](Remove_Curse "wikilink").

## Sorcerers at Lord Tier

Sorcerers are a welcome addition to any Lord group due to their
significant advantage in terms of mana in comparison with mages. Their
single-target spell damage is also the highest of any spellcasting
class, particularly while immolated.

## Sorcerer Remort Options

There are several options for remort races that work well for a
sorcerer - but these generally work well for any spellcasting class.

-   [Sprites](Sprites "wikilink") are terrific casters with huge mana
    pools but they have miserable hp further decreased by the sorcerer
    class (and thus almost always require
    [Quixoltan](Quixoltan "wikilink") devotion throughout hero tier).
-   [Demonseeds](Demonseeds "wikilink") are similar to the
    [Drow](Drow "wikilink"),
-   [Dragons](Dragons "wikilink") have identical mana as sprites
    (somewhat higher than tuataur) and are a fairly large race in terms
    of HP, as well as protected by excellent racial armor,
-   [Tuataurs](Tuataurs "wikilink") are well rounded in terms of both HP
    and mana, and make potent spellcasters,
-   [High Elves](High_Elves "wikilink") are good with anything that
    deals with spells.
-   [Trolls](Trolls "wikilink") which accept smaller mana gains and
    higher spell costs in exchange for higher HP and survivability via
    [revival](Racial_Revival "wikilink").
