*Long ago the planescape was ravaged by a hideous interplanar
abomination known as the [Soulgorger](Soulgorger "wikilink"). Many
powerful sages came together to perform a great magic that banished the
Soulgorger in its own pocket realm, completely isolated from the rest of
existence. Once every few centuries the stars aligned in such a way that
the great magic would become weakened. Whenever this happened the
Soulgorger would temporarily escape its realm to feast upon the spirits
of the living. Now after many ages of such intermittent feasting, the
Soulgorger has amassed enough power to pierce the veil of [the
Planescape](:Category:_Lord_Planes.md "wikilink"). Not surprisingly,
this happened where the barrier is at its thinnest: in [the emptiness
between the elemental planes](:Category:Nothing.md "wikilink").*
