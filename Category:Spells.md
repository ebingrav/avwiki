This is a list of spells available at the Lord tier.

There are three general types of spells: arcane, divine, psionic. All
spells belong to one of these types. Examples of where this might be
important: a sorcerer's main spells are arcane and thus could benefit
from the [Eye of the Oni](Eye_Of_The_Oni "wikilink") (25% chance of +10
caster lvl on arcane spells); when considering [Racial Spell Cost
Modifier](Racial_Spell_Cost_Modifier "wikilink") (for example Centaurs
get a 10% spell cost reduction on arcane and psionic spells, and a 15%
reduction on divine spells).
