## Directions

Walking route from [Nom](Nom "wikilink"): n, 9w.

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 17w, s, 5w, 3n, 3w, n,
w.

[Portaling](Portal "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Sol](Sol "wikilink").

## Connections

Stonehall connects with the [White Stone
Road](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") (part of Midgaardia's
[highway system](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink")) via a
narrow path to its east; opposite this road is a narrow trail that leads
into [the Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink").

A wooded trail leads northward from this same narrow path into the
boundaries of the neighboring [Oak
Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink"). A [hidden
door](Hidden_Doors "wikilink") in Stonehall's northwest corner opens
westward into the [Oak Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink"), as
well.

At present, Stonehall's second floor connects temporarily to a Hall of
Judging, where various player-designed areas submitted for 2005's
lowmort [area-building contest](Area-Building_Contests "wikilink") are
accessible; eventually, these contest areas will either disappear
forever or settle into a permanent spot somewhere else in Midgaardia.

## Navigation

Stonehall's main section is a 3-by-3 square centered around a marble
[fountain](Fountains "wikilink") where [Sol](Sol "wikilink") stands.
Various other useful [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") stand around its
periphery. Steps in its northwest corner lead upward to its second
floor, which is ring-shaped, free of [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"),
and lined with benches. See [Stonehall Map](Stonehall_Map "wikilink")
for more detail.

## Adventuring

As Stonehall has very few [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"), and as
none of them may be killed, players will need to venture elsewhere to
gain [experience](Experience_Points "wikilink"). The
[highways](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") just east of
Stonehall provide convenient access to many nearby
[areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") while vast
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") and its environs lie not far
westward beyond the [Oak Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink"). See
[Lowmort 11-20 Areas](:Category:_Lowmort_11-20_Areas "wikilink") for
more information on this subject.

Although Stonehall does not offer
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") any opportunities to gain
[experience](Experience "wikilink"), it does offer them many useful
services via its various [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") and
[rooms](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"). [Sol](Sol "wikilink"), who stands
at Stonehall's heart, is both a [healer](:Category:_Healers "wikilink")
and a default [recall](Recall "wikilink") point for all
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") between
[levels](Level "wikilink") 5 and 14. Southwest of [Sol](Sol "wikilink")
lies a [bank](:Category:_Banks "wikilink") and southeast of him stands a
[trainer](:Category:_Trainers "wikilink") named [Carl](Carl "wikilink").
Also, south of [Sol](Sol "wikilink") is a nice [ent](Ents "wikilink")
named [Edmuntrillion](Edmuntrillion "wikilink") who can
[identify](Identify_(command) "wikilink")
[items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") for a price. Stonehall has three
[shopkeepers](:Category:_Shopkeepers "wikilink"), as well: northeast of
[Sol](Sol "wikilink"), [Tilly](Tilly "wikilink") sells maps of local
[areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"); north of [Sol](Sol "wikilink"), [a
half-elven girl](Fletcher's_Daughter "wikilink") sells
[arrows](Standard_Arrows "wikilink") and
[bolts](Standard_Bolts "wikilink"), which
[archers](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") may find especially handy; and,
west of [Sol](Sol "wikilink"), [Silverbeard](Silverbeard "wikilink")
sells [food](:Category:_Foods "wikilink") and
[drink](:Category:_Drink_Containers "wikilink") (however, since Avatar's
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") no longer experience
hunger and thirst, his wares have little practical value these days).
[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") wanting to
[buy](Buy "wikilink") other types of
[goods](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") without traveling to
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") might find them for sale in
nearby [Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink").
