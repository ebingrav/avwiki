## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink"): 17w, s, 5w, 3n, 3w,
n, w.

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Sol](Sol.md "wikilink").

## Connections

Stonehall connects with the [White Stone
Road](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink") (part of
Midgaardia's [highway
system](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink")) via a narrow path
to its east; opposite this road is a narrow trail that leads into [the
Meadow](:Category:_Meadow.md "wikilink").

A wooded trail leads northward from this same narrow path into the
boundaries of the neighboring [Oak
Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle.md "wikilink"). A [hidden
door](Hidden_Doors.md "wikilink") in Stonehall's northwest corner opens
westward into the [Oak Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle.md "wikilink"), as
well.

At present, Stonehall's second floor connects temporarily to a Hall of
Judging, where various player-designed areas submitted for 2005's
lowmort [area-building contest](Area-Building_Contests.md "wikilink")
are accessible; eventually, these contest areas will either disappear
forever or settle into a permanent spot somewhere else in Midgaardia.

## Navigation

Stonehall's main section is a 3-by-3 square centered around a marble
[fountain](Fountains.md "wikilink") where [Sol](Sol.md "wikilink")
stands. Various other useful [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") stand
around its periphery. Steps in its northwest corner lead upward to its
second floor, which is ring-shaped, free of
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"), and lined with benches. See
[Stonehall Map](Stonehall_Map.md "wikilink") for more detail.

## Adventuring

As Stonehall has very few [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"), and as
none of them may be killed, players will need to venture elsewhere to
gain [experience](Experience_Points.md "wikilink"). The
[highways](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink") just east of
Stonehall provide convenient access to many nearby
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") while vast
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") and its environs lie not
far westward beyond the [Oak
Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle.md "wikilink"). See [Lowmort 11-20
Areas](:Category:_Lowmort_11-20_Areas.md "wikilink") for more
information on this subject.

Although Stonehall does not offer
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") any opportunities to
gain [experience](Experience.md "wikilink"), it does offer them many
useful services via its various [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink")
and [rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink"). [Sol](Sol.md "wikilink"),
who stands at Stonehall's heart, is both a
[healer](:Category:_Healers.md "wikilink") and a default
[recall](Recall.md "wikilink") point for all
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") between
[levels](Level.md "wikilink") 5 and 14. Southwest of
[Sol](Sol.md "wikilink") lies a [bank](:Category:_Banks.md "wikilink")
and southeast of him stands a
[trainer](:Category:_Trainers.md "wikilink") named
[Carl](Carl.md "wikilink"). Also, south of [Sol](Sol.md "wikilink") is a
nice [ent](Ents.md "wikilink") named
[Edmuntrillion](Edmuntrillion.md "wikilink") who can
[identify](Identify_(command).md "wikilink")
[items](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") for a price. Stonehall has
three [shopkeepers](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink"), as well:
northeast of [Sol](Sol.md "wikilink"), [Tilly](Tilly.md "wikilink")
sells maps of local [areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"); north of
[Sol](Sol.md "wikilink"), [a half-elven
girl](Fletcher's_Daughter.md "wikilink") sells
[arrows](Standard_Arrows.md "wikilink") and
[bolts](Standard_Bolts.md "wikilink"), which
[archers](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink") may find especially handy;
and, west of [Sol](Sol.md "wikilink"),
[Silverbeard](Silverbeard.md "wikilink") sells
[food](:Category:_Foods.md "wikilink") and
[drink](:Category:_Drink_Containers.md "wikilink") (however, since
Avatar's [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") no longer
experience hunger and thirst, his wares have little practical value
these days). [Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") wanting
to [buy](Buy.md "wikilink") other types of
[goods](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") without traveling to
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink") might find them for sale
in nearby [Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink").
