*Tarterus is the Demon homeworld. All imaginable types of vile Demons,
Daemons and Demodands call this twisted plane their home. They are ruled
there by the Dark Lord, Anthraxus, rumored to possess the legendary belt
of souls and boots of planewalking.*

*Once a feared realm of shadowy nightmares, it has since weakened and
lost some of its danger. But parts of it still lay untamed...*

## Comments

In general this isn't the scariest plane in the universe. Tart proper is
decent exp for a smallish group, but the mobs there web and demonfire,
so it can be a hassle. The [Garden](:Category:Garden.md "wikilink") is a
nice gear/exp run for a smaller group. The [Ring Of Higher
Power](Ring_Of_Higher_Power "wikilink") run has huge mobs and can be
extremely swarmy, so you probably shouldn't try it with less than 20
groupies. Also on this plane is the [Boots Of
Planewalking](Boots_Of_Planewalking "wikilink"), [Belt Of
Souls](Belt_Of_Souls "wikilink"), and [Guard Of The
Demogorgon](Guard_Of_The_Demogorgon "wikilink").
