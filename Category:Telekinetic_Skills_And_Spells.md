*Telekinesis is the basic [Psionic](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink")
principle of moving [objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") and
creating forces with one's mind. These spells are used for a variety of
purposes. It is not possible for even the most powerful
[psion](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") to directly damage a foe with
telekinesis. A squirming, fighting opponent is simply too hard to get a
secure mental grip on, so crushing or mangling with telekinesis is
implausible. Psionic Telekinetic attack spells thus use
[objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") as weapons, and include
[DART](Dart_(spell) "wikilink"), [BLAST BOLT](Blast_Bolt "wikilink"),
[TORCH](Torch_(spell) "wikilink"), [DETONATE](Detonate "wikilink"),
[WEAPON RUSH](Weapon_Rush "wikilink"), [DANCING
WEAPON](Dancing_Weapon "wikilink"), and [FANDANGO](Fandango "wikilink").
Other Telekinetic spells create forces for defense or other purposes.
They include [ENERGY SHIELD](Energy_Shield "wikilink"), [MENTAL
BARRIER](Mental_Barrier "wikilink"), and
[LEVITATION](Levitation "wikilink"). Since applying force to other
[objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") and
[people](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") is as easy as applying it to
oneself, all telekinetic spells can be [cast](Cast "wikilink") on
others.*
