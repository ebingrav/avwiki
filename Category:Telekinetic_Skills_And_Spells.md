*Telekinesis is the basic
[Psionic](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") principle of moving
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") and creating forces with
one's mind. These spells are used for a variety of purposes. It is not
possible for even the most powerful
[psion](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") to directly damage a foe
with telekinesis. A squirming, fighting opponent is simply too hard to
get a secure mental grip on, so crushing or mangling with telekinesis is
implausible. Psionic Telekinetic attack spells thus use
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") as weapons, and include
[DART](Dart_(spell).md "wikilink"), [BLAST
BOLT](Blast_Bolt.md "wikilink"), [TORCH](Torch_(spell).md "wikilink"),
[DETONATE](Detonate.md "wikilink"), [WEAPON
RUSH](Weapon_Rush.md "wikilink"), [DANCING
WEAPON](Dancing_Weapon.md "wikilink"), and
[FANDANGO](Fandango.md "wikilink"). Other Telekinetic spells create
forces for defense or other purposes. They include [ENERGY
SHIELD](Energy_Shield.md "wikilink"), [MENTAL
BARRIER](Mental_Barrier.md "wikilink"), and
[LEVITATION](Levitation.md "wikilink"). Since applying force to other
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") and
[people](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") is as easy as applying it
to oneself, all telekinetic spells can be [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") on
others.*
