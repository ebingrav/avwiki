*These are the most familiar
[Psionic](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") attack spells. They are
listed in order of damage dealt. [Psychic
Drain](Psychic_Drain.md "wikilink") and
[PsiSting](PsiSting.md "wikilink") cause damage by channeling raw
psionic energy into the target's body.
[Mindlash](Mindlash.md "wikilink") and
[Brainstorm](Brainstorm.md "wikilink") channel such energy into the
target's conscious mind; this is a more advanced and more damaging
technique. [Psionic blast](Psionic_Blast.md "wikilink") and
[Ultrablast](Ultrablast.md "wikilink") combine these two methods of
attack for truly impressive damage. All of these spells affect a single
target, since it is very difficult to channel psionic energy into
multiple targets. These spells' prerequisites proceed in a progressing
pattern of power: [psychic drain](Psychic_Drain.md "wikilink") -\>
[psisting](PsiSting.md "wikilink") -\>
[mindlash](Mindlash.md "wikilink") -\>
[brainstorm](Brainstorm.md "wikilink") -\> [psionic
blast](Psionic_Blast.md "wikilink") -\>
[ultrablast](Ultrablast.md "wikilink"). All basic attack and area spells
are more powerful for in-class users who do not have to fear a
counterattack thanks to a group-mate [tanking](Tanks.md "wikilink") the
target.*
