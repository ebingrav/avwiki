''A temple of [Gorn](Gorn.md "wikilink") is a rare thing in the known
worlds. Nobody knows how these temples form and where the
[monks](:Category:_Monks.md "wikilink") who inhabit them arrive from. It
is an enigma. They exist for their own reasons yet some, like the one
existing in the Plane of Thorngate, invite people to come and take
advantage of their strange soothing temple which somehow makes healing
easier. As long as you stay only within the path of silks and the Inner
Sanctum, the [monks](:Category:_Monks.md "wikilink") will allow you to
rest. To seek their hidden secrets is to seek death.

**Level Range:** 25-30

**Builder:** Odin

*<font color=red> Warning! The whole interior of the temple is seething
with monks who will attack everyone who is not of that class!*  
*Furthermore, it is cursed and nospell! This makes for really good dying
and tricky CRs. It is NOT suitable for level-25 NON-monks! </font>*

For [monks](:Category:_Monks.md "wikilink"), on the other hand, it is
safe and the place they can find [their

[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") in this area wear hitroll gear.
