*A temple of Gorn is a rare thing in the known worlds. Nobody knows how
these temples form and where the monks who inhabit them arrive from. It
is an enigma. They exist for their own reasons yet some, like the one
existing in the Plane of Thorngate, invite people to come and take
advantage of their strange soothing temple which somehow makes healing
easier. As long as you stay only within the path of silks and the Inner
Sanctum, the monks will allow you to rest. To seek their hidden secrets
is to seek death.*

This area is cursed nospell. It's a fun place for a few people to get
some easy nospell xp.
