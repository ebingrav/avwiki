*Once, [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") was the home of [a
great temple dedicated to the immortals of
Avatar](:Category:_Temple_Of_AVATAR "wikilink"). It was enormous,
containing the Cleric Guild, a massive library, and the statues of the
[Immortals](:Category:_Immortals "wikilink") of Avatar. Now, its once
massive dome is no more. The temple became the property of
[Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith "wikilink"), goddess of healing, and
[Werredan](Werredan "wikilink"), god of war. Their
[priests](:Category:_Priests "wikilink") and
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") have hired the best architects
and masons the world has ever known to build the new grand temple. Home
to both groups of [clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") and to their
guards, the new structure is a site to behold. It has public
sanctuaries, where the devote can worship, along with private areas for
the [clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink"),
[priests](:Category:_Priests "wikilink"), guards and their staff.
Beware, the Temples are under the protection of the King of Midgaard.*

## Connections

This area connects to [Midgaard](:Category:Midgaard "wikilink").

## Navigation

This area houses the [Cleric](Cleric "wikilink")'s guild, found on the
first west fork immediately after entering the Temple. The west half of
the temple is for [Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith "wikilink"), while the east half
is for [Werredan](Werredan "wikilink"). The halves are essentially
mirror images. Both halves have three floors.

## Adventuring

This area replaces the [Temple of
AVATAR](:Category:Temple_Of_AVATAR "wikilink").  
There are a few mobs at the bottom floor that can be killed for exp. The
upper floors have some bigger mobs, as well as some gear. However, the
gear is nothing special, and it is not possible to access the upper
floors unless one has [Pick Lock](Pick_Lock "wikilink") or [Pass
Door](Pass_Door "wikilink"), or if one uses
[Teleport](Teleport "wikilink") to reach a mob on the upper floor.
Oddly, the keys to access the upper floors are on mobs found on the
upper floors.  
This area is not the greatest for exp due to its low mob count, and the
fact that many of the mobs are [citizens](Citizen_Mobs "wikilink"). The
gear is not spectacular, either. In the future, this area may be used in
conjunction with [Worship](Worship "wikilink").
