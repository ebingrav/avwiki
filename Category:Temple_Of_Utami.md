*Looking out over the [island of
Utami](:Category:_Island_Of_Utami.md "wikilink") is the fabled Temple,
home of the empress and emperor of the once huge Empire of Utami. These
days the few remaining inhabitants live a secluded life and they go
about their business without seemingly interfering with the outside
world too much. It is said that many treasures are to be found on the
island and in the Temple itself several artifacts of power are hidden.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

**Builder:** Kariya

## Directions

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink"): 39s, e, 5s, 4e, 5s,
3w, 5s, e, 4s (note: crosses [water
terrain](Water_Terrain.md "wikilink")).

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested:
[Merline](Merline.md "wikilink").

## Connections

-   [Island of Utami](Island_Of_Utami.md "wikilink")
-   Entering the altar at the [Statue Of The Evil Dark
    Ruler](Statue_Of_The_Evil_Dark_Ruler "wikilink") takes you to
    [Neraka](:Category:_Neraka.md "wikilink").
-   Alteratively, you can give the [Peculiar Black
    Gem](Peculiar_Black_Gem "wikilink") (found inside the throne 6 south
    of [Merline](Merline "wikilink")) to the [Statue Of The Evil Dark
    Ruler](Statue_Of_The_Evil_Dark_Ruler "wikilink") and it will take
    you to a different room in Neraka (n, w from [The High
    Priest](Highpriest.md "wikilink")).

## Navigation

This area is fairly easy to navigate. All rooms on the top except for
the room with Merline are cursed. All the areas on the bottom are not.
The room with the statue of Utami is private. It is a simple Tau cross
shape on top and a simple 3x3 grid on bottom.

## Adventuring

A small [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") with very few
[aggies](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink"), good
[exp](Experience_Points.md "wikilink"), and some
[gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") to boot. It also seems to repop
very quickly. Great for lowhero runs.

Only a few [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") here, so don't expect
to go all of spells here while on a run.

Mobs of interest:

-   [Statue Of The Evil Dark
    Ruler](Statue_Of_The_Evil_Dark_Ruler "wikilink") has the [dark
    flaming blade](Dark_Flaming_Blade.md "wikilink"), which makes a nice
    offhand.
-   [Statue Of The Red Archer](Statue_Of_The_Red_Archer "wikilink") has
    the [red bone bow](Red_Bone_Bow.md "wikilink"), the easiest to get
    [hero-level bow](:Category:_Hero_Missile_Weapons.md "wikilink").
-   [Mavis Wariso](Mavis_Wariso "wikilink") has the hit gear [ring of
    Purity](Ring_Of_Purity.md "wikilink").
-   [Statue Of Utami](Statue_Of_Utami "wikilink") has the mana gear
    [Small Toe-Ring](Small_Toe-Ring "wikilink") and the [heal
    brandie](Suggested_Spellcasting_Gear#Suggested_Healing_Gear.md "wikilink")
    [Emerald Sceptre Of Light](Emerald_Sceptre_Of_Light "wikilink").
