*Atop the domed roof of the [Temple of
Avatar](:Category:_Temple_Of_AVATAR.md "wikilink") stand several very
old, very unstable towers of stone. Occasionally, stones from these
towers will come loose, slide down the curve of the dome and brain a
passing citizen. Some say [Gargoyles](Gargoyles.md "wikilink") throw
these rocks.*

## Connections

## Navigation

## Adventuring

A nice rarely-run [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"), suitable to be
soloed from about 20 on with a few spells.

To walk to this area, you need the key on the paladin guard. He is a
[lawful mob](Lawful_Flag.md "wikilink"); attacking him will make you an
[outlaw](Outlaw.md "wikilink"). You cannot use [pass
door](Pass_Door.md "wikilink").

When you reach the spires, be careful of a few
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"). One is the Anthropomorphic Dragon
Gargoyle, which hits a lot harder than the others. If you choose to
enter any of the towers, make sure you don't wander into [The
Game](:Category:_Game.md "wikilink"), unless you REALLY wanna die.

You can find the hidden [hunchback](Hideous_Hunchback.md "wikilink")
here, and he has [a bent and mangled
ring](Bent_And_Mangled_Ring.md "wikilink"), which is excellent hitgear
if you are evil or get it harmonized or [faded](Fading.md "wikilink").

The mobs in this area are not strongly aligned, making it easier to
maintain evil or neutral alignment.
