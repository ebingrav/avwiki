    Celestial, seeing the growing dissatisfaction with prolonged
    battles that Lords undertake daily, and that seem to be without
    purpose or end, has decided to strengthen their resolve. Troubled
    by visions of what is bound to happen should the Lords cease their
    vigil, he decided to summon them, and to share these visions of
    unavoidable futures. Visions, which are all but pleasant.

    "Is there a way to permanently balance the future, avoid the
    destruction bound to happen, when that future is already inevitable?",
    the Celestial asks, as he ponders at the possibilities,
    "That, in itself, is the Conundrum."

## Guide

Shift earth, north, 4 x west and then enter nexus.

East, can set anchor here, and up to the Celestial.

After mprog, enter vision, more mprog (no regen room, will Auto-CR here
if you die), head down.

From here, try heading north, north, south which will take you to a new
room (Cathrarobel, the Rubble City)

Then try east, south, west, clear mobs then enter en.

Clear mobs and head west, then 4 x south.

Here you'll fight a mob called "Quest fellowship of superheroes" - it
cannot be killed so have all casters stop casting during this fight to
save mana. Eventually a mprog will start which will lead to a casting of
calm: enter the portal at this point.

Kill the mob in this no-exit room. A few more will join. Eventually a
prog will start which will create a crack. The room is silent at this
point so make sure to brief groupies ahead of time. First you'll see a
"CRRRAACCKK" then a "CRASH" the a large amount of blank space/empty
lines. At the point the crack has spawned and you can enter it (tanks
first! remember its silent).

The next room is the final fight and its very tough. Have troll revive,
have casters surge up, max veil and have your tank enter the crack first
(though this can be difficult due to silence). Anyone who doesn't enter
the silence will eventually die.

After the fight, grab all the corpses and skin them later for your loot.
Gurney any group mates that died and head east and then enter vision.

You'll be back at the Celestial. Kneel here for the Miniscule Time
Vortex insig (2 week temp insig, regen boost). You can home from here
and skin your loot.
