These [weapons](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") provide a little
something extra for [rogues](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink"),
[fusilers](:Category:_Fusiliers "wikilink"),
[warriors](:Category:_Warriors "wikilink"), and [black circle
initiates](:Category:_Black_Circle_Initiates "wikilink"). Some of these
[weapons](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") have many attributes so close
examination is important. While they are a type of weapon they are not
an object with type=weapon (they have type=throwing) - so they cannot be
[sharpened](Sharpen_Weapon "wikilink") with a whet stone,
[enchanted](Enchant_Weapon "wikilink"), or improved with the
[rune](Rune "wikilink") command. Some of them may, however, be [
poisoned](:Category:Poisons "wikilink").
