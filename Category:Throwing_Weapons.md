These [weapons](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") provide a little
something extra for [rogues](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink"),
[fusilers](:Category:_Fusiliers.md "wikilink"),
[warriors](:Category:_Warriors.md "wikilink"), and [black circle
initiates](:Category:_Black_Circle_Initiates.md "wikilink"). Some of
these [weapons](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") have many attributes
so close examination is important. While they are a type of weapon they
are not an object with type=weapon (they have type=throwing) - so they
cannot be [sharpened](Sharpen_Weapon.md "wikilink") with a whet stone,
[enchanted](Enchant_Weapon.md "wikilink"), or improved with the
[rune](Rune.md "wikilink") command. Some of them may, however, be [
poisoned](:Category:Poisons.md "wikilink").
