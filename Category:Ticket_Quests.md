"Ticket Quests" are quests that are written into areas, do not require
any staff or other players to set up, and reset themseves along with the
rest of the area. With very few exceptions, they are all endlessly
repeatable. Ticket quests are flexible, but the typical flow of a quest
is: find a [ticket](:Category:_Tickets.md "wikilink"), use clues from
the ticket's description, the location, or the mob you looted it from to
determine which mob accepts it, then give it to that mob in exchange for
a [reward](:Category:_Ticket_Quest_Rewards.md "wikilink"). Another
variation of a ticket quest would be one in which you know which mob
wants a ticket, but not where to find it or even what it is. Note that a
ticket is always destined for a specific mob, and no other mob will ever
accept it.

Years ago, the standard way to complete a quest was through ticket
mechanics; that is, exchanging a valueless item for an item you can use.
Now that mobs are more scriptable, quests can take many forms that don't
involve tickets at all, though many still do. This can make it harder to
determine whether or not you're in posession of a quest-related item,
but in many of these quests mobiles will explicitely say what they want
you to do or get.
