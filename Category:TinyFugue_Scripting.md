TinyFugue can be obtained from <http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/>  
TinyFuge (TF) is a flexible, screen-oriented (console) MUD client, for
use with any type of MUD.  
There are, supported, versions available for UNIX, OS/2, Windows, MacOS,
BeOS. There are also unsupported version for VMS and Amiga.  
The learning curve for TF is a bit steep, but once you have figured out
the syntax for creating macroes/triggers/etc you may never go back to
your old clients.

There is a copy of the TinyFugue Documentation available on this server
at: <http://melanarchy.info/tf>

If you have trouble building tf on Leopard add \#include \<sys/types.h\>
to the list of includes in src/malloc.c
