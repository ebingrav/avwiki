*It is technically accurate to say that the Titans exemplify talent,
dedication, and power. Such an assertion, however, is akin to saying
that Bhyss is occasionally a little ungregarious.*

*A few impudent mortal leaders have sent armies into battle with Gods.
The Titans have led those armies, and they can claim victory over the
most mighty beings in the Realm.*

*Once, in the days long past that provided all the substance of today's
gossip and speculation, a Titan wished to cross a river. Dissatisfied
with the craftsmanship of the bridge, he crafted a new one from a nearby
forest. Still inimical to the crossing, he finally simply diverted the
river's flow into the ocean, in the process flooding ten villages and
ending a centuries-old tribal feud by drowning all the participants. He
then decided not to cross the river after all and continued on his
journey.*

*Such an immense achievement characterizes but a fraction of the Titans'
true ability. The indiscriminate use of that mastery of magic and nature
may explain why there are no Titans today.*
