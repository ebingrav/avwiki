*Northeast of the [Desiccated
Farmland](:Category:_Desiccated_Farmland "wikilink") sits a plateau high
in the mountains. The [Great Northern
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") ends somewhere within
its depths, and it has been rumored that the terrain has been altered
magically for unknown reasons. Perhaps the land provided an experimental
arena for the [caster](Cast "wikilink"), perhaps it simply amused him or
her to change the natures of land and beast. The Wayfinder, alarmed at
the rumors and desiring to learn for himself what might have occurred,
sent out one of his most trusty [rangers](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink")
to explore, and is still waiting for his return.*

## Adventuring

As far as high lowmort goes, I'm in love with this area. The other day,
I tanked here with my level 40ish archer, I brought along a
casting/brandishing mage, a hitting/bashing warrior, and a sponging psi,
and we managed about 2k in spells. Not bad for a non-twinked 40s group
if you ask me. Not saying this area is a walk in the park though. Some
mobs are bigger than others, there are aggies, and some rooms are in
water, so fly/breathe. All in all though, a wonderful area and a welcome
addition to the level 40-50 game.
