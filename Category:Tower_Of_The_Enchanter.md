The tower is an excellent alternative to the meadow to fight in if you
are concerned about alignment, as the mobs here will generally raise
your alignment.

There are two main parts to the area: the field and the tower. In the
field there are various coloured goops, some of which carry hunks and
chunks of goo. The chunk is food (hence useless) but the hunk is a low
level cure light pill.

South and East of the entrance is another field where some bigger goops
are that carry crystalline goo: this is a low level remove curse pill.
Farther south and east leads to the entrance to the tower.

Inside the tower the books will assist, and the animated pillow will
aggy. On the top floor, the animated suit of armor has the simple sword
of honour - a good weapon for low level chars. The enchanter himself has
the black glowstone, which is an antigood permalight.

Watch out for zombies - the enchanter will animate corpses! Don't fight
them if you're below level 30.
