*Once, a long time ago, this stretch of forest in the southern reaches
of what is now called [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink") was the
pride of Mid-gaardia - for those who relish in the growth and bloom of
things at least, or in the hunting of them. But alas, here the violent
and endless battles that left half the continent disfigured with scars
to deep to heal raged without mercy to creatures and nature. Only few
rumours have found their distorted way into the bars and to the dinner
tables of the cities of Midgaardia though. The stories that made it
spoke of an abundance of evil creatures, of destruction and mayhem that
suggested that there was no forest left standing. Yet descriptions of
what might have replaced it seem so contradictory, that it can only be
attributed to the chinese whispering from mono-syllable
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") to meditating
[druid](:Category:_Druids "wikilink"), from proud
[centaur](Centaurs "wikilink") to scared traveller, from bored gate
guard to drunken bartender.*

## Navigation

A note on the map: apparently the room "gaping hole in a tortured
reality" with the mob "eye of the storm" has exits which change their
destination on every repop. I'm not sure if other rooms also do this,
but obviously something to watch out for when leaving that room. I
suspect even if they change they will be rooms nearby, as on the map.

There are five logical sections (named for a notable room in it) to the
area:

-   The splintered forest to the northeast is largely uncursed, and is
    satisfyingly swarmy for area casters.
-   Along the fringe of a swirling vortex along the south edge of the
    area is filled with ghosts and a [corpse
    animator](Mass_Of_Memories "wikilink") (the only sanced mob there --
    only animates mob corpses). The safe room at the [scarred
    ent](Heavily_Scarred_Ent "wikilink") is adjacent. There are a few
    private rooms up from the safe room. The room just north of the ent
    is private and uncursed, though you cannot set recall here.
-   Beneath a bulging slab is southwestish from the entrance, past a
    one-way down exit. You can go back up from the pitch-black shadow
    mob (it's aggie and sanced). It is filled with tentacles and shadow
    beasts and wolves, and is also satisfyingly swarmy. There are a few
    private rooms down from here, with the [Seething Core Of
    Tentacles](Seething_Core_Of_Tentacles "wikilink").
-   The ice tree lies past locked passproof doors and requires bashdoor
    to navigate (ed: eat it, wizards! ;) ). It is filled with rooms with
    random exits, but is seminavigable if you learn to recognize the
    sentinel mobs. It is filled with multiple types of mobs, most
    notably drifting ice breathing mobs, so be sure to cast [mystical
    barrier](Mystical_Barrier "wikilink") if possible. Because a repop
    means that all the bashed doors close and lock, be sure to have an
    escape plan!
-   In ice tree, from the room with the mob "Slowly swinging branches"
    (on scan: "Swinging from side to side the thick branches block
    further progress") bashdoor east to get to the un-cursed room in the
    area. Watch out for the [Gigantic Ice
    Spider](Gigantic_Ice_Spider "wikilink") (82) which can backstab for
    over 3k hp.
-   On cracked ground is a tiny 4-room section that connects the
    uncursed forest section to the southern fringe. It is filled with 2
    types of rock wyrms. One type eats mob corpses and the other type
    eats PC corpses. The [Seasoned Ranger](Seasoned_Ranger "wikilink")
    is in the easternmost room.

## Adventuring

If you plan on coming here, make frequent use of the [heavily scarred
ent](Heavily_Scarred_Ent "wikilink") to keep your hps up, as things can
get nasty quickly and the swarmy nature of this cursed area makes a CR
difficult. Also, try to bring a caster as their area spells are
incredibly useful in this area.

This is a huge hero area with lots of aggie and dangerous
(mimic/eater/animator/scrambler/stomper) mobs. It can also get VERY
swarmy so a bit of hp is necessary to survive here. The same factors
also make it a fun place to run as well as very good xp.

To get to this area, usually pp [Stone
Trickster](Stone_Trickster "wikilink"), e, 2s, pull bloom, s. From
there, you can go either west (leading to Beneath A Bulging Slab) or
east (leading to the other 3 areas). Most of the mobs here don't have
armor, but some of the rangers do. All mobs are biggish.

Notable mobs are:

-   [Seasoned Ranger](Seasoned_Ranger "wikilink"): sentinel, non-aggie,
    will assist against evil chars/mobs
-   [Mass Of Memories](Mass_Of_Memories "wikilink"): Wandering corpse
    animator (only mob corpses) in the swirling vortex part
-   [Crushing Force Of Stone](Crushing_Force_Of_Stone "wikilink"):
    Wanders, stomper
-   [Stone Wyrm](Stone_Wyrm "wikilink") and [Digger
    Wyrm](Digger_Wyrm "wikilink"): Corpse eaters, stompers
-   [Mad Hunter](Mad_Hunter "wikilink"): Mimic - wanders in the
    splintered forest
-   [Distortion](Distortion "wikilink"): Mimic - wanders in the fringe
    of swirling vortex part
-   [Young Druid](Young_Druid "wikilink"): Archer mob with poison
    (biotoxin) arrows, wanders in the splintered forest
-   [Eye Of The Storm](Eye_Of_The_Storm "wikilink"): Invis, sentinel
    mob. Casts mnd spells like scramble and overconfidence
-   [Fading Hunter](Fading_Hunter "wikilink"): sentinel, non-aggie,
    cursed room. Carries [Necklace Of Assorted
    Wood](Necklace_Of_Assorted_Wood "wikilink").
-   [Heavily Scarred Ent](Heavily_Scarred_Ent "wikilink"): Sentinel,
    safe room, [infirmary](Infirmary "wikilink")
