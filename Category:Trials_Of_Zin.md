## Navigation

## Adventuring

Note: Be wary of the statue in the room A Test of Admittance below Zin,
which was the old walking route to the area (before portals became
easier to obtain). This mob wields, hits very hard, and is aggressive.
Also, note there is an aggressive rabbit southwest of Zin, and being
level 53, it is fairly large for a level 35 character to fight, for
instance.

This is a great area for solo casters from level 25-40, or small groups
of 2-3. The most frequently run sections are the Hall of Oddities
southwest and up of zin, and the Volcano. The best xp, however, is in
the guardian air elementals, the giants in the training yard, the
priests southeast of Zin and especially the rocks, boulders and stones
in the garden south of Zin. (The latter are fairly large, wander, are
lvl 52, and sometimes load 3 per room, so make sure to have hp/mana
available).
