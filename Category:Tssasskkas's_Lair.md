*Within the bowels of Devil's Peak lies the lair of the
[demon](Demons.md "wikilink") [Tssasskkas](Tssasskkas "wikilink"). A
mighty necromancer, the [demon](Demons.md "wikilink") is said to raise
the bodies of those who fall within her realm so that they may serve her

w, n, u, n, u, 6n, w, u, n, u, e, u, n, w, s, u, n, u, e.

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested:

## Connections

-   [North Of Ofcol](:Category:_North_Of_Ofcol.md "wikilink")
    ([map](North_Of_Ofcol_Map.md "wikilink")).
-   [Cloud Dracoleum](:Category:_Cloud_Dracoleum.md "wikilink")
    ([map](Cloud_Dracoleum_Map.md "wikilink")).

## Navigation

Starting from entrance the following sections can be discerned:

-   Entrance cave with passageways and non-aggressive mobs,
-   Below [Spawner](Spawner "wikilink") (animator), a small underwater
    section with [Cretellis](Cretelli "wikilink") and
    [Mantellis](Mantelli "wikilink") (corpse eaters),
-   The [Spirit of Tzzan](Spirit_Of_The_Lich.md "wikilink")'s tower,
    submerged in water with semi-aggressive animated Lord players
    attacking it (stabbers, casters),
-   A series of tubes - tunnels and slopes, a swarmy section with many
    large aggressive mobs (all sorts of nasty),
-   Through quest doors - a part with even larger water mobs that
    special groupies are required to access,
-   Grand finale - the cavern leading to stalagmite with [Eyeless
    Terrors](Eyeless_Terror "wikilink"), (scramblers/mnd) and finally
    [Tssasskkas](Tssasskkas "wikilink") (animator).

At a glance, the area is not a breeze.

## Adventuring / Exploration Walkthrough

The first section is the uncursed cavern and not difficult to solo with
small characters. Beware there is a cloner. Here you can find
[Rockfist](Rockfist "wikilink"), a good portal point, who also carries a
piece required for the main quest - a "fake" catseye gem that is
actually a ticket. From entrance room go 3e, n, open w, w to access
[Spawner](Spawner "wikilink")'s room - an aggressive animator perhaps
best left alone.

Below Spawner is the second section, with *Narrow chimney* being a good
place to set recall. It it filled with two types of sharks,
[Cretellis](Cretelli "wikilink") and [Mantellis](Mantelli "wikilink"),
which are corpse eaters. The [Cretelli Tooth](Cretelli_Tooth "wikilink")
is a skin item useful for archers. At the end of this section is a fake
Tssasskkas's Lair with an animated corpse of one, which is aggie. There
is a vortex here leading to the third section.

Noticeably more full of aggressive mobs, the waters around the Lich's
tower are full with tongue-in-cheek animated Lord players that stalk the
group - watch out for Pico and Juliet, those two can stab for
obliterating through full spells. The other animated corpses do not
aggie. Pico is also carrying [Pouch Of Rogue
Tools](Pouch_Of_Rogue_Tools "wikilink"), an useful set of tools. If you
are intent on doing battle here, see [Fizzing White Potion
Quest](Fizzing_White_Potion_Quest "wikilink"). Inside the Lich's towers
are three fully safe rooms, and the last place to set recall before the
next sections. While here, also take note of the anti-magic rooms, as
getting caught in one with a solo mage low on mana means death - there
is no fleeing in water. There are some anti-magic rooms onwards as well.

From the south-eastern room of the main cavern's upper layer, eastwards,
is a blind solitary room. Entering it by going east, and going again
east, will return you to Main cavern, but going west (not intuitive)
will drop you in the fourth section. Once here you will be immediately
set upon by vipers that poison and elementals that throw group-damaging
thrown weaponry. Trouble is that these weapons (balls of energy) tend to
return to the mobs, killing them and robbing the group of a significant
amount of xp.

XP-wise, this is the best part of the area, providing you have a good
tank and a group capable of doing much damage, fast. To the north is a
small block of two air rooms, just prior to the first of quest doors,
where you can sleep uninterrupted and optionally respell.

The first door requires pushing a magical stone (need your detects up)
to get through. This door (and others beyond) are known to cut groupies
off, so beware - as engaging immediately in combat on the other side
means you cannot operate the lever to let your groupies in until the
combat is done.

Beyond this door is the fifth section, a cavern with wyrms (probably
dragons as they're huge, tail, and don't take much damage), but not as
swarmy as previous section. The north-western corner of the four Small
Cavern rooms contains an up exit to [Cloud
Dracoleum](:Category:Cloud_Dracoleum.md "wikilink"), landing you one
room beneath the [Shadow Sovereign](Shadow_Sovereign "wikilink"). To the
south is the second door that requires a rogue(like) groupie to operate
the lever (Decahedral stone). A BCI can open this door as they are
roguish enough. Going southwards here is soon a mute room (no chatting!)
and 2 rooms later a sponge-filter solitary room. When you come near the
15+ bugs infesting a mute blind room, don't worry, one burning hands
will kill them all.

Going east from the rogue-only lever is immediately a psi-only wall.
This is visible to mnd as well as BCI (who can open both quest doors!).

Once on the other side of the psi wall, you will find the sixth section,
the inner cavern, with a stalagmite on the far end.
[Jumaras](Jumara "wikilink") here will use more ranged weaponry, and
climbing the stalagmite you will encounter the two [Eyeless
Terrors](Eyeless_Terror "wikilink"). These scramble, hit very hard, and
are huge. Loot them for their armors, [Carburized Steel Plate
Armor](Carburized_Steel_Plate_Armor "wikilink") equivalents. One room
further up is the [Tssasskkas](Tssasskkas "wikilink"), the area boss.

Once done, consider returning to the lich to complete [Jaranon Great
Sword Quest](Jaranon_Great_Sword_Quest "wikilink").

As a final note, dying in the last sections (cursed, no walking exits)
with or without survivors lacking means to gurney groupmates
(bzk/sor/shf), will require a large CR party. Since fleeing is
impossible due to water environment, always be ready to calm and
teleport out, if at all possible.

## Affects

As of October 2011, the area features a sizable increase in experience
gains and a moderate increase in hp and mana regeneration.
