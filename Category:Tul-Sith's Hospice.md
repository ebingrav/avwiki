*The [priests](:Category:_Priests "wikilink") and
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") of
[Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith "wikilink"), the
[goddess](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses "wikilink") of healing, wanted a
place where they could [train](:Category:_Trainers "wikilink") their
followers in solitude. So they sought a place away from the cities and
towns and there they built their hospice. Nestled in the northern
mountains, they provide a place of healing for those who cannot find it
elsewhere. They also provide [training](:Category:_Trainers "wikilink")
to those who have dedicated themselves to the healing arts, no matter
their [god](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses "wikilink").
[Priests](:Category:_Priests "wikilink"),
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink"), chirugeons, and
[paladins](:Category:_Paladins "wikilink") all make this glade their
home.*
