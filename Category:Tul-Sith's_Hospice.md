*The [priests](:Category:_Priests.md "wikilink") and
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics.md "wikilink") of
[Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith.md "wikilink"), the
[goddess](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses.md "wikilink") of healing,
wanted a place where they could
[train](:Category:_Trainers.md "wikilink") their followers in solitude.
So they sought a place away from the cities and towns and there they
built their hospice. Nestled in the northern mountains, they provide a
place of healing for those who cannot find it elsewhere. They also
provide [training](:Category:_Trainers.md "wikilink") to those who have
dedicated themselves to the healing arts, no matter their
[god](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses.md "wikilink").
[Priests](:Category:_Priests.md "wikilink"),
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics.md "wikilink"), chirugeons, and
[paladins](:Category:_Paladins.md "wikilink") all make this glade their
home.*
