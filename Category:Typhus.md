*Near the top of the Devil's Peak, a battle of wills between the
[elven](Elves.md "wikilink") healer [Tyslin
San](Tysiln_San.md "wikilink") and her enemies has begun to threaten the
mortal realm. The powerful [demon lord
Typhus](Demon_Lord_Typhus.md "wikilink") has formed a vast
[portal](Portals.md "wikilink") and is pulling his forces through to lay
waste to the fair lands of Midgaardia.
[Tyslin](Tysiln_San.md "wikilink") has trapped the
[demons](Demons.md "wikilink") inside a mystical
[fountain](Fountains.md "wikilink"), but it is unknown how long her
enchantment can hold back the tide.*

**Level Range:** 51-51

## Connections

-   [North Of Ofcol](:Category:North_Of_Ofcol.md "wikilink")
    ([map](North_Of_Ofcol_Map.md "wikilink"))

## Navigation

The area has two layers - the upper is connected with the lower via a
single staircase, and is somewhat bigger than the lower part. Also, it
has weaker mobs. The [Demon Lord Typhus](Demon_Lord_Typhus "wikilink")
can be found in the lower part, behind a closed, pass-proof but unlocked
door (simply open it!).

The only two cursed rooms are the chamber of Typhus (so recall set
either east or north of it) and the top of the staircase.

## Adventuring

The starting layer is a rectangular area containing Spined Devils (note:
these use wields, and can't be [decepted](Deception.md "wikilink")
because of [tranquility](Racial_Tranquility.md "wikilink")), Dretches,
and Quasits (note: these are [invisible](Invis_Flag.md "wikilink") and
will [assist](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink") mobs). The Dretches are the
good for experience, and Spined Devils are a tad bit annoying as they
are [flying](Flying_Flag.md "wikilink")
[fleers](Wimpy_Mobs.md "wikilink").

Once you have cleared out this section, head in an eastern direction
until you reach a passageway that leads to the big
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"). You will find a Stone Guardian at
the top of the staircase that can smash small groups/groupies so be
careful. After you defeat this one, you will find another after you go
down and through the northwestern passageway. Once you have conquered
this, open the west door and you will find a square room with two Demon
Guardians and the [Demon Lord Typhus](Demon_Lord_Typhus.md "wikilink")
himself. The Guardians are good exp for minimal work. If your up to the
challenge Typhus is a big mob with some nifty stuff (see gear) and a lot
of exp for small groups. He resides in the southwest corner of this
plot.

This area is suitable for experienced soloers with a bit of
[hp](Hit_Points.md "wikilink"), and smaller groups finishing or starting
a run.

-   Aggie Mobs: Stone Guardians, Demon Guardians, and Typhus.

<!-- -->

-   Non-Aggie Mobs: Spined Devil, Dretch, and Quassit
    ([invis](Invis_Flag.md "wikilink")
    [assister](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink"), though).
