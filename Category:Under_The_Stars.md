*It is always night in Noctopia. Amid its endless gardens and riverside
walkways, one can find any number of Dark Fae, their pets and guests.
Through the plane flows a river of reddish hue, akin to blood but
lacking its odor or foulness. Ancient legends speak of this river
draining the very life from any it touches.*

**Builder:** Dev

## Directions

If you haven't already summoned the [Planar
Anchor](Planar_Anchor "wikilink"), you need to clear
[Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia.md "wikilink") shift and go s, d, w, {d}.
Note that the last door can be bashed.

## Connections

s, d, w, \[d\] from shift will take you to a
[Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink") room in [Under The
Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars.md "wikilink").

According to Dev this area has 4 exits. I -think- this is all of them:

-   grate up to [Pits Of Blood And
    Chain](:Category:Pits_Of_Blood_And_Chain.md "wikilink")
-   down from waterfall to
    [Unravelling](:Category:Unravelling.md "wikilink")
-   wetern iron walkway entrance to [Obsidian Arena;
    Floor?](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Stands.md "wikilink") (spellable,
    only two mobs)
-   eastern iron walkway entrance to [Obsidian Arena;
    Stands](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Stands.md "wikilink") (I think
    this one is nospell and swarmy)

## Navigation

This area is divided into two sections: the bleeding tunnels and the
iron walkway. When you first enter [Under The
Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars.md "wikilink") from the [Shiftwatch
Orb](:Category:Shiftwatch_Orb.md "wikilink") you'll find yourself in the
bleeding tunnels.

The iron walkways portion of this area is much less dangerous. Since
this part of the area isn't cursed, you can portal here as soon as you
enter [Under The Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars.md "wikilink").
"Panthrax" is an acceptable portal point.

Note that some of the pets (either pet panthraqs or pet devils or both)
are corpse eaters.

## Adventuring

'This first room of the area is [Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink"). Also,
[Planar Anchor](Planar_Anchor "wikilink") stays in one place now, so if
you can set up an anchor here, you don't have to deal with
[Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia.md "wikilink") shift anymore!

The bleeding tunnels are cursed, noregen, and patrolled by the
wielding/bashing/disarming/tracking [Ethereal
Stalkers](Ethereal_Stalker "wikilink"). Instruct your tanks to rescue
each other if one gets bashed.

The iron walkways are uncursed and regenable. Here you can find
[Yorimandil The Blind](Yorimandil_The_Blind "wikilink") (sometimes) and
entrance(s) to [Obsidian Arena;
Stands](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Stands.md "wikilink").
