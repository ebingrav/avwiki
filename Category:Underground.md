## Connections

This area is reached via the [Tortured
Terrain](:Category:Tortured_Terrain.md "wikilink"). It also has a
connection to one of the [Ruined
Lairs](:Category:Ruined_Lairs.md "wikilink") and a one-way exit into
[Midgaard Country](:Category:Midgaard_Country.md "wikilink").

## Navigation

Containing only 9 rooms in total, this location is extremely easy to
navigate.

Essentially a single tunnel with a couple of turns, and a door to divide
the tunnel into two. A single hidden room can be found along the
north-south section of the tunnel. The tunnel ends in a one-way door
which exits (somewhat strangely) into a loft in a farmhouse in [Midgaard
Country](:Category:Midgaard_Country.md "wikilink").

## Adventuring

Containing no mobs at all, this area is pointless for adventuring.

Almost all of those coming here will be doing so to claim the [Antique
Emerald Necklace](Antique_Emerald_Necklace "wikilink"). Once, long ago,
the [Crystal Lantern](Crystal_Lantern "wikilink") was a popular item as
the lowest level permenant light source in the game, however it now has
a limited duration and those collecting it will most likely only be
after a curio.
