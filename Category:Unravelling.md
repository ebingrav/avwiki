*"Somehow, the [Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia.md "wikilink") that now
exists is not the waning realm it was when it vanished. The Army that
now mans the Obisidian Arena is far stronger than the hamstrung force
that [Zarradyn](Duke_Zarradyn.md "wikilink") led to defeat. And despite
history recording the epic of her demise, the Dark Queen herself sits
upon the Throne [Under the
Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars.md "wikilink").*

*It is the [Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia.md "wikilink") that never was,
a realm where all 13 of the original Dark Fae still live, and Arcadia
has been crushed under their collective heel. That both outcomes to a
single war should exist simultaneously seems unnatural to say the least.
Surely there will be a price to pay."*

## Directions

From the [Lloydable](Lloydable "wikilink") room in [Under The
Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars.md "wikilink") head east then south
then down, looking for a room called "waterfall" with exits
north/west/down. Down from there takes you to this area.

Or, from the underground pool in [Dark Fae
Tower](:Category:Dark_Fae_Tower.md "wikilink") head north (instead of
south). There you'll find a down exit to this area.

## Connections

Connects to [Under The Stars](:Category:Under_The_Stars.md "wikilink")
and [Dark Fae Tower](:Category:Dark_Fae_Tower.md "wikilink") as
described above.

## Navigation

Both entrances place you in a up/down shaft, at the middle of which is a
safe room. From the safe room you can head north towards
[Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia.md "wikilink"), south towards
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia.md "wikilink"), or east/west into a maze.

## Adventuring

This area is very dangerous.

First of all, since it lies in the
[Nowhere](:Category:Nowhere.md "wikilink") plane, you can't gurney
fallen groupies. Have them [Requiem](Requiem "wikilink") their corpses,
and [Threnody](Threnody "wikilink") them after the run. If they aren't
patient enough for that, then [Eulogy](Eulogy "wikilink") is always an
option.

All of the mobs here drift, so you can find yourself amidst a swarm
without warning. For this reason backup tanks are very important here.
The drifting nature of the mobs here also means that you shouldn't
expect to get much sleep once you enter this area.

Once you enter the up/down shaft the main mobs to watch out for are the
[Chaos Beasts](Chaos_Beast "wikilink"). The reason they hurt so much is
because their weapons are poisoned with
[Necrotia](:Category:_Necrotia.md "wikilink"). Naturally, these weapons
have an inventory flag, so they can't be looted. The weapons are also
cursed, so they can't be disarmed. I also think that the mobs are
tranquil (and can't be decepted) but this needs confirmation. The only
ways to avoid their [Necrotia](:Category:_Necrotia.md "wikilink") are to
use immaculate, detonate, or shatter strike. [Chaos
Beasts](Chaos_Beast "wikilink") are also spec_wizard, which means that
they can cast [Shard Storm](Shard_Storm "wikilink"). This makes for
great fun in the det portion in the area (see below).

At the center of the up/down shaft is the [Weaver
Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink"). This room is fully safe, so take a
well deserved nap once you reach her.

If you enter the east/west maze from the [Weaver
Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink") you won't be able to return to her
room. This maze also has drifter mobs. For these reasons you should make
sure that your group is very healthy before entering the maze.

Once inside the maze you'll find the same [Weaver](Weaver "wikilink")
and [Chaos Beast](Chaos_Beast "wikilink") mobs you met in the up/down
shaft portion of the area. In addition to them, there is a mob called
[Essence Collector](Essence_Collector "wikilink"). It is
spec_telekinetic (DETS!) but doesn't hit as hard as the other two.
Casters running naked are likely to be annihilated by the [Chaos
Beasts](Chaos_Beast "wikilink") casting [Shard
Storm](Shard_Storm "wikilink"), so having attentive healers is a plus on
this run.

Somewhere in the maze you can find the [Unmaker](Unmaker "wikilink"), a
mob that only HiEs can affect. See its article for more information.
