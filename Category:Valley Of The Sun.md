## Navigation

This is a relatively straight area. Starting from the south you travel
north and up. Straying too far from the path leads to other areas.

## Adventuring

If you see a giant vulture, two sentinel mobs named Wartha and Velkor,
or a bunch of samurai-related mobs, you're in the wrong area. So be sure
to know what the area map looks like, there are plenty of exits you
shouldn't take.

Basilisks and scorpions are not aggressive with the exception of the
Greater Basilisk, whose description should appear on scan as "An
especially large basilisk...". On the upper levels from the bottom of
the area, you will encounter ettins;these do aggie sleepers, and the
she-ettin aggies anyone.

This is a good area for solo caster xp at 33-42 or a duo, though at
higher levels the mobs assist.
