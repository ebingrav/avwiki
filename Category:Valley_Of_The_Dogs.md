*Somewhere off [White Stone
Road](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink") lies a small valley.
It is rumored to be a short cut to the [goblin
caverns](:Category:_Goblin_Caverns.md "wikilink"), but this hasn't been
confirmed. The adventurers that went there--and made it back alive--say
that a large pack of wild dogs prey here, along with
[goblin](Goblins.md "wikilink") hunting parties. Many brave men, women
and its have found their demise here. Will you be one of them?*
