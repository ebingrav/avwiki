*The [gnome](Gnomes "wikilink") village of Gnimh is far removed from the
greater kingdom of the [gnomes](Gnomes "wikilink"). Originally
established as an exploratory encampment years ago, Gnimh has grown to
be the point of contact between [gnomes](Gnomes "wikilink") living in
the greater Midgaardian area, and their kin back home. In order to
better facilitate this an administrative complex was built, which later
took on the additional task of training the promising youth of the
"frontier" in the ways of diplomacy and scholarship. The village itself
boasts only a modest population, mostly comprised of students and staff
for the academy, most [gnomes](Gnomes "wikilink") preferring to live
quietly in the surrounding countryside.*

## Connections

This area is connected to [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"), [Rivers of
Avatar](:Category:_Rivers_Of_Avatar "wikilink"), [River
Folk](:Category:_River_Folk "wikilink"), and [Underway
Tunnels](:Category:_Underway_Tunnels "wikilink").

## Navigation

Most adventurers enter from the [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"). The first section is a
linear path leading through the town. The end of the path splits of into
two, with the east path going to the [Underway
Tunnels](:Category:_Underway_Tunnels "wikilink"), and the west path
going to the academy. Most of the mobs are in the academy. The academy
has four floors and a basement.

## Adventuring

The Village of Gnimh is similar in concept to
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink"), except it has fewer
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") and a smaller
[level](Level "wikilink") range on [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink").
As with [Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink"),
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") here will lower your
[align](Alignment "wikilink"), but it's a good place to pick up
[xp](Experience_Points "wikilink") if you don't care about
[alignment](Alignment "wikilink") (it's farther from
[Sol](Sol "wikilink"), hence, it has less players running through it.)

As with [Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink"), there are a
large number of [wandering](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"), and a few stationary
shopkeeps/officers/etc. Roughly, the order of difficulty is:

-   Children/Youths
-   Citizens, Cadets, Freshmen
-   Villagers, Sophomores, Seniors
-   Shoppies/Guards/Officers

As with most other low [levels](Level "wikilink"), use
[consider](Consider "wikilink") liberally to find out the size of the
[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") you're fighting.

The [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") itself is made up of two main
parts: the village (where you enter from the [White Stone
Road](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink")), and in the southeast
corner of the village, the Gnimh academy. Again, no outstanding
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") or
[aggies](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink"), just well written
[rooms](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") with lots of
[wandering](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink").

As far as [gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") is concerned, the jeweller
has the [Jeweler's Loupe](Jeweler's_Loupe "wikilink"), which is the only
piece of [int gear](:Category:_Int_Gear "wikilink") for the head for a
long time. Get it if you need a bit of an int boost for
[practicing](Practice "wikilink").

For those interested in lore, this area contains quite a bit about the
history of gnomes, as well as some culture. Those looking for an
amusement can attempt to find the fourth floor of the academy. Nothing
there, but fun to find. (Hint: figure out how the elevator works.)
