*To the north of the kobold town of
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside.md "wikilink") is a large, rich apple
orchard owned by a man named
[Owen](Owen_The_Orchard-Owner.md "wikilink"). Rumor says that the reason
there are so many [kobolds](Kobolds.md "wikilink") selling apples in
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside.md "wikilink") is because they pilfer them
from [Owen](Owen_The_Orchard-Owner.md "wikilink")'s Orchard.*

**Level Range:** 3-5

## Connections

This area is connected to [Wayside](:Category:_Wayside.md "wikilink")
and [Highways/Great Wall.](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink")

## Navigation

A fairly uniform area, with paths between rows of trees. There's a
treehouse you can set your recall location to and look cool. See the map
for details.

## Adventuring

Another relatively simplistic lowbie area, it can be reached by going
straight north from [Nom](Nom.md "wikilink") (opening the hidden gate in
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside.md "wikilink")) and west. The
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") in this area seem to be a bit
easier than the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") in
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside.md "wikilink"), but it is hard to tell at
low [levels](Level.md "wikilink"). They don't seem to hurt
[alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink"), either.

The gardener has the [wooden pipe](Wooden_Pipe.md "wikilink"), which is
low level [wisdom gear](:Category:_Wis_Gear.md "wikilink") for the head
slot. Otherwise, there is not much of note in this
[area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"). If you go far enough north, you
will end up on the [White Stone
Road](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink") that runs north of
[Sol](Sol.md "wikilink").
