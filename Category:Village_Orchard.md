*To the north of the kobold town of
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside "wikilink") is a large, rich apple orchard
owned by a man named [Owen](Owen_The_Orchard-Owner "wikilink"). Rumor
says that the reason there are so many [kobolds](Kobolds "wikilink")
selling apples in [Wayside](:Category:_Wayside "wikilink") is because
they pilfer them from [Owen](Owen_The_Orchard-Owner "wikilink")'s
Orchard.*

**Level Range:** 3-5

## Connections

This area is connected to [Wayside](:Category:_Wayside "wikilink") and
[Highways/Great Wall.](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink")

## Navigation

A fairly uniform area, with paths between rows of trees. There's a
treehouse you can set your recall location to and look cool. See the map
for details.

## Adventuring

Another relatively simplistic lowbie area, it can be reached by going
straight north from [Nom](Nom "wikilink") (opening the hidden gate in
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside "wikilink")) and west. The
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in this area seem to be a bit easier
than the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in
[Wayside](:Category:_Wayside "wikilink"), but it is hard to tell at low
[levels](Level "wikilink"). They don't seem to hurt
[alignment](Alignment "wikilink"), either.

The gardener has the [wooden pipe](Wooden_Pipe "wikilink"), which is low
level [wisdom gear](:Category:_Wis_Gear "wikilink") for the head slot.
Otherwise, there is not much of note in this
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"). If you go far enough north, you
will end up on the [White Stone
Road](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink") that runs north of
[Sol](Sol "wikilink").
