*There have been many rumors over the years regarding a group*of divine
adherents who have come to be known as Viziers. Some *people whisper
about suspected links to a fallen god from the*Second Giant-Ent war
while others joyfully tell tales of the ''miraculous healing they have
received from the order.

*Their utter reluctance to use any form of weapons or shields*while
staunchly supporting their comrades has earned them ''a grudging form of
respect despite their ... unusual methods.

*The following is a torn off page from a Vizier recruitment*brochure
found in Midgaard:

*Requirements:  
*\* level 50 Cleric  
''\* ???  
**Abbreviation:** Viz.

**[Base Class](:Category:_Core_Classes.md "wikilink"):**
[Cleric](:Category:_Clerics.md "wikilink").

**[Prime Requisite](Prime_Requisite.md "wikilink"):**
[Wisdom](Wisdom.md "wikilink").

## Viziers in General

All [Viziers](:Category:_Viziers.md "wikilink") learn both healing and
damage spells, area as well as targeted. However they cannot wield or
hold (offhand) items and cannot worship.

## Vizier Creation

To become a Vizier you need ...

1.  Level 50 [Cleric](:Category:_Clerics.md "wikilink").

Once these requirements have been met, seek out
[Alcanus](Alcanus "wikilink") (portable, from Aelmon: wwssu) in the
Second Level of Tower in [Midgaard](Midgaard "wikilink"), and she will
induct you.

Good creatable races for Viziers have decent hit points, no fail
casting, and divine [ spell reduction
cost](Racial_Spell_Cost_Modifier.md "wikilink") (which is of particular
importance to Viziers as they're mana gains are minimal).
[Centaur](Centaur "wikilink") is probably the best of the creatable
races with good hit points and a -15% spell cost reduction on divine
Spells. Other good creatable race options include Elf/Drow (lower tnl,
-10% spell cost), Liz (for remort), Ent (if you can stomach the TNL),
Gnome (-5% spell cost reduction) and Dwarf (-5% but not nofail until
97%).

Viziers get rerolled when they prestige, to include their practice
points. Also low hero Vizier life can be tough. An option is to do the
first 100 hero levels as a Cleric and save 200 practices to prestige NLT
100. You can use the excess practices to get spells/skills prior to
prestige.

## Viziers at Lowmort Tier

### DC Quests

These are very tough as a Vizier. If remorting race, it's worth
considering staying a Cleric until after you remort. You can also
rebirth back to cleric, do lowmort as a Cleric, then prestige again as a
Vizier. This method will NOT clear your creatable DC insigs.

## Viziers at Hero Tier

### Practicing

Phlebotomize, cures, and healing spells until you get viz spells at 100.

### Devoting

Viziers cannot worship

### Fighting

**Soloing:** Very tedious. Wear mana gear to regen then swap to AC to
fight. Use surged harm (or desiccate but out-of-class lag is bad) to get
mob down to big nasty wounds then cast phlebotomize from there.

**Tanking:** Viz aren't great tanks, due to no wield slots, out of class
rescue, and lag. Their best spells are cast at the end/after a fight,
and require between a half round to a full round of lag, which slows
down the run.

**Hitting:** Viz hit terribly when a mob is between excellent and big
nasty wounds, but hit quite well when the mob is at awful. Blood nova is
the most powerful hero area spell in the game, but requires a pool in
order to cast it.

**Healing:** Viziers are some of the best healers in the game. You will
need to find a balance of casting phlebotomize to gain mana, and final
rites/sanguen pax to heal while at the same time not slowing the group
down. Phlebotomize will do terrible damage and cost you mana if cast
when the mob is between excellent health and big nasty wounds.
Phlebotomize allows you to GAIN mana when cast on a mob that is pretty
or awfully hurt (as well as doing decent damage). Mana gains/damage are
based on racial spell cost, surge level, and how hurt the mob is.
Maximum mana is gained at surge 0, awful (50 for liz, 55 for tua, 53 for
hel, 58 for hie, 58 for cen, 43 for min). To create pools, you must
first cast final rites on a mob. Final rites has a very short spell lag.
After a mob with final rites is killed, a pool will be created that can
then be used with sanguen pax (or blood nova if looking to deal damage).
Sanguen pax has a medium spell lag (half a round or so) and will heal
all group members in the room. Healing amount is based on augment level
and racial/gear/quest bonuses/negatives. Expect 400+ hp per cast at
augment 0. Augment 2 will give 600+. If there are multiple viz in the
group, each viz can create a pool off the mob.

### Gear

#### Hero

Viziers typically run in either mana gear, tank gear, or a mix. Having a
pool of 500+ mana can be helpful for many reasons. Here is a list of
"viz" gear (ac/mana).

-   light
-   finger [Antharian Signet Ring](Antharian_Signet_Ring "wikilink")
-   neck [Rune Of Life](Rune_Of_Life "wikilink")
-   on body
-   head [Skull With Huge, Curved
    Horns](Skull_With_Huge,_Curved_Horns "wikilink")
-   legs
-   feet [Wolverine Fur Boots](Wolverine_Fur_Boots "wikilink")
-   hands
-   arms [Sapphire Studded Sleeves](Sapphire_Studded_Sleeves "wikilink")
-   about body [Snow Leopardskin
    Cloak](Snow_Leopardskin_Cloak "wikilink")
-   waist [Font Of Power](Font_Of_Power "wikilink")
-   wrist
-   held [Heart Of The Forest](Heart_Of_The_Forest "wikilink")

## Viziers at Lord Tier

At the Lord tier Viziers want as big a mana pool as they can get to
maximize the amount of souls they can harvest with soul shackle. Thus,
start with standard [:Category:Lord Mana
Gear](:Category:Lord_Mana_Gear "wikilink"). There is a possibility of
creating gear with similar mana stats, but adding AC via the
[transmogrify](transmogrify "wikilink") gear.

The Enervate spell replaces Phlebotomize and Vitae Flux replaces Sanguen
Pax.

Viziers gain additional options at lord. Fights will often still start
with the Vizier casting final rites however they then have the option to
soul shackle which causes them to take spell damage in exchange for a
bigger pool.

## Vizier Remort Options

Viz have no remort classes available to them. Good remort races are any
with good hp, reduced spell cost, and no fail (tua/hie are popular).
