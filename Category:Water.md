*The Elemental Plane of Water is a plane consisting entirely of liquid.
The beings that call this plane home are usually very peaceful unless
summoned to another plane. There they either follow the commands of the
one who summoned them or go berserk trying to find a way home. However,
strange things have begun to happen in the Elemental Planes, and the
Plane of Water is no different. Normally placid elementals have become
violent beasts, attacking anyone and anything that invades their
domain.*
