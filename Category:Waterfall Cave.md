*One of the homes of the creatures overtaking the [ruins of the city of
High Drow Elves](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria "wikilink"), this small
cave is on the northern edge of the ruins. For years, it has been ruled
by Zaswyi, who lived in relative peace with his [drow](Drow "wikilink")
neighbors. Recently he was overthrown in a coup by
[Octyin](Octyin "wikilink"), whose sole goal was to plunder the
[drow](Drow "wikilink") city for
[treasure](:Category:_Treasure "wikilink"). Rumor has it the lesser
[drows](Drow "wikilink") were planning to raid the cave in retaliation
for the creatures invading the ruins and taking the temple
[treasures](:Category:_Treasure "wikilink"). A band of
[drows](Drow "wikilink") were sent to defeat the creatures, but thus far
the battle is a stalemate, with each side taking heavy casualties.*
