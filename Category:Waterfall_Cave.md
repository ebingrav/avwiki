*One of the homes of the creatures overtaking the [ruins of the city of
High Drow Elves](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria.md "wikilink"), this small
cave is on the northern edge of the ruins. For years, it has been ruled
by Zaswyi, who lived in relative peace with his
[drow](Drow.md "wikilink") neighbors. Recently he was overthrown in a
coup by [Octyin](Octyin.md "wikilink"), whose sole goal was to plunder
the [drow](Drow.md "wikilink") city for
[treasure](:Category:_Treasure.md "wikilink"). Rumor has it the lesser
[drows](Drow.md "wikilink") were planning to raid the cave in
retaliation for the creatures invading the ruins and taking the temple
[treasures](:Category:_Treasure.md "wikilink"). A band of
[drows](Drow.md "wikilink") were sent to defeat the creatures, but thus
far the battle is a stalemate, with each side taking heavy casualties.*
