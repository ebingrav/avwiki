*The [Kobold](Kobolds.md "wikilink") town of Wayside is a small row of
ramshackle dwellings just over the hill to the north of [The
Meadow](:Category:_Meadow.md "wikilink"), and serves as home to the many
failures who can't quite seem to successfully graduate
[MUDschool](:Category:_Avatar_Mudschool.md "wikilink"). Wayside caters
to the needs of the average adventurer, and the
[kobolds](Kobolds.md "wikilink") will be more than happy to sell you
everything from stolen apples to leaky waterskins. If you are in town
and after a little quality merchandise, the General Store run by
[Liam](Liam.md "wikilink") the [gnome](Gnomes.md "wikilink") is
supposedly the best deal in town. The free apple cider in Wayside's Fat
Badger Inn is rumored to pack quite a wallop.*

**Level Range:** 2-5

## Connections

This [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") connects to the [Underway
Tunnels](:Category:_Underway_Tunnels.md "wikilink") (eastish and through
the garden) and the [Village
Orchard](:Category:_Village_Orchard.md "wikilink") (all north from
entrance until you come to the hidden gate north).

## Navigation

## Adventuring

One of the few evil-[aligned](Alignment.md "wikilink") [newbie
areas](:Category:_Lowmort_1-10_Areas.md "wikilink"). A fun little
[area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"), not as bland or homogenous as
the [meadow](:Category:_Meadow.md "wikilink"). Definitely worth
exploring if you've never checked it out before.

There are two [aggy](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink") characters in the
area: the carnivorous squirrel in the tree of death ("Uh oh! This
squirrel has big pointy teeth" on [scan](Scan.md "wikilink")) and
Ugly-Beard in the hidden room north of the Mudschool Dropout Tent. If
you are a smallish character, it's probably best to avoid both these or
stack kill [commands](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") in them.
Uglybeard has a vial of briny seawater which is a
low-[level](Object_Level.md "wikilink") [cure
light](Cure_Light.md "wikilink") and [protection
evil](Protection_Evil.md "wikilink")
[potion](:Category:_Potions.md "wikilink").

As far as other [gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") goes, Burt the
Village Idiot has the [Village Idiot's paper
crown](Village_Idiot's_Paper_Crown.md "wikilink"), which is wisdom head
gear. [Cousin Lakkee](Cousin_Lakkee "wikilink") has the [Very Ugly
Amulet](Very_Ugly_Amulet "wikilink"), which is intelligence neck gear.

There is also the potential to get a little money in this area. Seek out
the chest where [Cousin Lakkee](Cousin_Lakkee "wikilink") is, and help
[Liam](Liam "wikilink") with his quest.

Most of the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") in the area will
[assist](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink"), so be wary of big rooms of
[kobolds](Kobolds.md "wikilink") if you are low on
[hp](Hit_Points.md "wikilink"). [Liam](Liam.md "wikilink") (fat little
[gnome](Gnomes.md "wikilink") on [scan](Scan.md "wikilink")) is
[nofight](Safe_Rooms.md "wikilink"), but the
[room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") isn't
[cursed](Cursed_Rooms.md "wikilink") so you can always
[flee](Flee.md "wikilink") and [recall](Recall.md "wikilink") if in
trouble.
