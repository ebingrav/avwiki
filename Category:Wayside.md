*The [Kobold](Kobolds "wikilink") town of Wayside is a small row of
ramshackle dwellings just over the hill to the north of [The
Meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink"), and serves as home to the many
failures who can't quite seem to successfully graduate
[MUDschool](:Category:_Avatar_Mudschool "wikilink"). Wayside caters to
the needs of the average adventurer, and the
[kobolds](Kobolds "wikilink") will be more than happy to sell you
everything from stolen apples to leaky waterskins. If you are in town
and after a little quality merchandise, the General Store run by
[Liam](Liam "wikilink") the [gnome](Gnomes "wikilink") is supposedly the
best deal in town. The free apple cider in Wayside's Fat Badger Inn is
rumored to pack quite a wallop.*

## Connections

This [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") connects to the [Underway
Tunnels](:Category:_Underway_Tunnels "wikilink") (eastish and through
the garden) and the [Village
Orchard](:Category:_Village_Orchard "wikilink") (all north from entrance
until you come to the hidden gate north).

## Navigation

## Adventuring

One of the few evil-[aligned](Alignment "wikilink") [newbie
areas](:Category:_Lowmort_1-10_Areas "wikilink"). A fun little
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"), not as bland or homogenous as the
[meadow](:Category:_Meadow "wikilink"). Definitely worth exploring if
you've never checked it out before.

There are two [aggy](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink") characters in the area:
the carnivorous squirrel in the tree of death ("Uh oh! This squirrel has
big pointy teeth" on [scan](Scan "wikilink")) and Ugly-Beard in the
hidden room north of the Mudschool Dropout Tent. If you are a smallish
character, it's probably best to avoid both these or stack kill
[commands](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") in them. Uglybeard has a vial
of briny seawater which is a low-[level](Object_Level "wikilink") [cure
light](Cure_Light "wikilink") and [protection
evil](Protection_Evil "wikilink")
[potion](:Category:_Potions "wikilink").

As far as other [gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") goes, Burt the
Village Idiot has the [Village Idiot's paper
crown](Village_Idiot's_Paper_Crown "wikilink"), which is wisdom head
gear. [Cousin Lakkee](Cousin_Lakkee "wikilink") has the [Very Ugly
Amulet](Very_Ugly_Amulet "wikilink"), which is intelligence neck gear.

There is also the potential to get a little money in this area. Seek out
the chest where [Cousin Lakkee](Cousin_Lakkee "wikilink") is, and help
[Liam](Liam "wikilink") with his quest.

Most of the [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in the area will
[assist](Assistive_Mobs "wikilink"), so be wary of big rooms of
[kobolds](Kobolds "wikilink") if you are low on
[hp](Hit_Points "wikilink"). [Liam](Liam "wikilink") (fat little
[gnome](Gnomes "wikilink") on [scan](Scan "wikilink")) is
[nofight](Safe_Rooms "wikilink"), but the
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") isn't
[cursed](Cursed_Rooms "wikilink") so you can always
[flee](Flee "wikilink") and [recall](Recall "wikilink") if in trouble.
