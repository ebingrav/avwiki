*The oaks of [Oak Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink") continue to
the west and north before finally giving way to prairies and hills. An
ancient evil has gained a foothold within the Westwood.
[Rangers](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") have responded to help fight
the evil and protect the forest. Rumors tell of [a ghostly
creature](Pyris "wikilink") that threatens to eradicate the last of the
unicorns of Westwood.*

## Connections

Westwood presently connects to several areas, namely the [ Oak
Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink") to its southeast, the [ Odevar
Hills](:Category:_Odevar_Hills "wikilink") to its northeast, [Graw
Akkuurattaan](:Category:Graw_Akkuurattaan "wikilink") to the east, [
Centaur Camp](:Category:_Centaur_Camp "wikilink") to its northwest, [
Qanza Prairie](:Category:_Qanza_Prairie "wikilink") to its west, [
Tiureess](:Category:_Tiureess "wikilink"), [ Darklin
Hole](:Category:_Darklin_Hole "wikilink") and [Centaur
Hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow "wikilink") to its south, and the [
Ruins of Westwood](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Westwood "wikilink") below it.

## Navigation

Westwood consists of various winding woodland trails patrolled by a few
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") and wandered by many evil
darklin insectoids. Players may have difficulty navigating Westwood
without using a [ map](Westwood_Map "wikilink").

## Adventuring

The centipedes and millipedes are perhaps the best mobs to kills in this
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"). Be careful of the hornets as they
may [poison you](Biting_Mobs "wikilink").

Type 'where scarab' often, to keep an eye on this
[aggie](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")
[corpse-eating](Corpse-Eating_Mobs "wikilink") mob and stay away from it
as it is probably the hardest thing about. It generally repops in the
northwest, but moves around.

The statue in the middle of the wood is actually a
[fountain](Fountains "wikilink") which [refreshes](Refresh "wikilink")
your [moves](Move_Points "wikilink"), which can be useful with all the
wandering around that this area often entails.
