*In a quiet part of [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink") east
from [Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink") live a devout band of
[monks](:Category:_Monks.md "wikilink") known as the White Lotus Clan.
The clan came here seeking peace and meditation but their prowess at
fighting became famous across the land. People now travel here from afar
to learn from the clan's skilled fighting techniques and ultimately to
try and prove their worth in the fabled testing chambers of the White
Lotus.*
