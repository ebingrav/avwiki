of the many dark places hidden within it, such as the [tower of the
Gith](:Category:_Githzerai_Tower "wikilink") and the [Lairs of the
Dragons Kastinius and
Nigurathus](:Category:_Red_Dragon's_Lair "wikilink").*

## Navigation

The area is a large maze consisting of two large branches that merge
together on their way towards the [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"). It is easy to get lost
due to repetitious room names, so use the tour guide stationed at the
entrance from the Wall to reach a place quickly and with explanations.

## Adventuring

The level 20s-range rock bear mobs aren't worth fighting due to their
sanc and wimpy flags, but the other mobs in the area provide excellent
xp for solo casters or small duos from 26-38. The northern part of
wildwood is less favorable, given that the centaur mobs there are
generally archers and hit harder.
