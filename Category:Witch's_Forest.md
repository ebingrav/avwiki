*On the outskirts of [Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink")
in a dark forest, a [witch](Wicked_Witch_(Witch's_Forest).md "wikilink")
has entered into an unholy alliance with some of the more unpleasant
[races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") that inhabit Midgaardia. The
[witch](Wicked_Witch_(Witch's_Forest).md "wikilink") is known to
sacrifice people that enter her forest, so look out!*

**Level Range:** 5-10

**Builder:** Minx

## Connections

This area is connected to [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink").

## Navigation

The first section is a fairly linear path leading through the forest.
Most of the mobs for gear and exp are here. At the end of the path is
the Witch's house, where you can find the [Wicked
Witch](Wicked_Witch "wikilink").

## Adventuring

This is one of the first levels whose creatures have a good range of
difficulties. As such, remember [consider](Consider.md "wikilink") is
your friend and use it liberally on the different types of
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"). The
[area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") is
[dark](Dark_Rooms.md "wikilink") so make sure to bring a
[light](:Category:_Lights.md "wikilink") along.

For lower level [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"), stick
to killing the kobolds, the [dryad](Dark_Dryad.md "wikilink"), and the
[water sprites](Water_Sprite.md "wikilink"). One of the
[kobolds](Kobold_(Witch's_Forest).md "wikilink") may be wearing
[buck-skin gloves](Buck-Skin_Gloves.md "wikilink"), which are +dex gear
for hands - decent if you don't have anything else on your mitts
already. Higher-end chars should try the [evil
goblins](Evil_Goblin.md "wikilink") and the
[orcs](Hairy_Orc.md "wikilink"), but be aware they have wields.

The [raven](Raven_Familiar.md "wikilink") that wanders around has the
black key needed to unlock the witch's cottage at the end of the area.
To get to the cottage, you'll have to walk in a big counter-clockwise
spiral, being mindful of the numerous one-way paths that can make life
confusing.

The [witch](Wicked_Witch_(Witch's_Forest).md "wikilink") at the end of
the cavern is pretty tough, and she holds a +3 damroll wield.
