*Once upon a time, a long long time ago, a tree called Yggdrasil grew
tall in the area outside of Solace. But men, being as they are, saw only
that chopping it down would provide them with a lot of wood with which
to build their houses and shops. A battleworn goblin carved up the
remainder and used it to create a business for himself.*

*But the World Ash is immortal, or so the legends say. If it dies, the
world dies. And since the world is still here, so must the World Tree
still be ... somewhere.*

*Unlike in the past, you can no longer just walk up to it and climb its
branches. You must seek out its hidden entrance. Once there, if you can
find them, you will find memories of places you thought had left this
plane forever. Instead, the World Tree has captured their escenses and
provides you with memories... and new experiences.*

## Navigation

The tree is actually not that large, three levels connected with
vertical trunk rooms. Of note are the portals on the tips and edges of
the levels (*enter glow*) which connect randomly across the tree.

## Adventuring

Demons and similar beasts roam across the tree, but some interesting
mobs can be found which may require paying attention to (for example the
lizardmen pianist). The end-portals will probably be linked to other
areas over time, but for now they haphazardly (and randomly) connect
across the tree itself.
