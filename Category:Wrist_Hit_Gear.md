This article is for the benefit of those who are seeking **Hit** gear
for the **Wrist** slot, but are not neccessarily interested in what the
'best' gear is for their level.

There may be many reasons for this, but at least one is that gear which
has a mix of qualities may be desired and as such sacrificing a certain
amount of hit for other increases, such as mana or tank benefits, could
prove beneficial. This could be useful for a character who runs solo and
as such may desire a particular balance of gear, or even those who would
like to hit a little bit harder without sacrificing so much of their
mana.
