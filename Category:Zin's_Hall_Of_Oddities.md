*The wily [wizard](:Category:_Wizards.md "wikilink") known to the Realm
only as [Zin](Zin.md "wikilink") has added another peculiar test to his
[Citadel full of Challenges](:Category:_Trials_Of_Zin.md "wikilink").
Rumor speaks of it only as the Hall of Oddities. Its contents are a
rumor to most. With [Zin](Zin.md "wikilink") involved, it could be
almost anything.*

**Level Range:** 35-35

**Builder:** Dev

## Directions

---CAUTION---: If you follow the below instructions, there is an aggie
statue on the way there that will 1-shot most lowmorts. You should
probably try finding a portal instead of following the below
instructions. The statue is well-known to people who have played AVATAR
for a long time, but there is no mention of it anywhere, so newbies
beware.

Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink"): 16e, \[e\], 2e, 2s,
2d, \[e\], 4u, 2w, s, w, u.

Walking route from [Zin](Zin.md "wikilink"): 2w, s, w, u.

Speed-walking statue: alias skip d:open e:e. 16e, \[e\], 2e, 2s, d,
skip, 4u, 2w, s, w, u.

You'll need fly as well to walk to the area.

[Portaling](Portal.md "wikilink") point(s) suggested: oddity (note:
there are a few and they [wander](Wandering_Mobs.md "wikilink")).

## Connections

## Navigation

## Adventuring

One of the most commonly run mid-lowmort
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"). Groups come here after around
[level](Level.md "wikilink") 20 with spells, otherwise 25 or so. Decent
[xp](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") for 4-5 member groups, better with
less. [Archers](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink") will have a hard time
hitting here, period. As in will do no damage, so dont expect to duo
with an arc here, even with [held shot](Held_Shot.md "wikilink").

All [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") will
[assist](Assistive_Mobs.md "wikilink") after you reach
[level](Level.md "wikilink") 31.

A few things to be mindful of:

-   If you cant seem to find the name of a mob, try kill ab.
-   When it says read the sign, do so, unless you want to wander into
    the solo quest for [killing gloves](Killing_Gloves.md "wikilink")
    ([hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink")+ recommended).

Ideally, solo here at 29+ for [Dragons](Dragons.md "wikilink"). With
good [ac](Armor_Class.md "wikilink") and
[hr](Hit_Roll.md "wikilink")/[dr](Damage_Roll.md "wikilink") you wont
get hit too often, or too hard (my [drg](Dragons.md "wikilink")
[war](:Category:_Warriors.md "wikilink") is [lv](Level.md "wikilink")
31, -141 and 45/75, solos here for 80+xp/kill usually, running off
crims, sanc pills, and healies).
