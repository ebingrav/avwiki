*The stars in the night sky wheel and turn about our world. Used by some
to navigate, by others to mark the turning of the seasons, the stars and
the constellations they form have long been studied by those who would
gain an insight into the future.*

*It is said that tucked away between the worlds, in the space between
now and then, is an academy of astrologers who use special methods to
study the heavens in unusual and very personal ways. The astrologers are
said to have accumulated the greatest store of lore on the stars known
to Midgaardia to date, available to all those who care to spend the time
to look.*

## Navigation

The area opens with the single unconnected room - the Academy. quaffing
from there leads to the wide-opened mesh that is the Zodiac. It's a
rather small area but filled with mobs and interconnected well.

There is a path from the first room after the quaff to the queen up.
Each of the up directions are blocked by a gate that requires you to
pull a 'hidden knowledge'. You will need (in order) Spring, Summer,
Autumn, and Winter knowledge. These can be found from the mobs at each
of the principle ecliptic rooms.

## Adventuring

If you are here for questing, spend time and read in the Academy about
the celestial phenomena. These occur as mobs in the area proper, and
knowing what one is supposed to encounter will help in determining what
is the player missing and should probably spend time searching for.

The area proper is also loaded with lore, but this is not quest-related,
only flavor. Tons of it though.

All the gear is spiritlinked and bound to the player, so it cannot be
used on other alts. Gear is quite good and should help the slower races
in reaching hero.

## Comments

*"Zodiac has been built based on the theme of the grandfathered area
'Galaxy'. It seeks to recapture some of the flavour of that area, while
making something unique to AVATAR, use a theme which is more fitting,
and at the same time enhance the lore of the world." -- Izanagi*
