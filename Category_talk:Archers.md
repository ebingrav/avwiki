Neyne, you mention explosives damage armored mobs. Well, splinters do
too, if the mobs have jsut a few pieces of gear - I've noticed damage
with splints going from MANGL to \*MASSA in redtooth, for example.
However, this does not mean explosives *work*. I ran with them in
divide, ehas, etc, and in many places where mobs were armored they did
absolutely nothing. Nils (not misses). Can you give me an example of a
mob or area you run with them where they maintain their damage against
armored mobs? [WinterRose](User:WinterRose.md "wikilink") 02:24, 26

I went to hamlet of kreigstadt where some of the watchmen are well
geared with on body, about body, and shield pieces, and I consistently
nilled with splinters but hit with explosive
arrows.--[Neyne](User:Neyne.md "wikilink") 10:51, 26 January 2013 (EST)
