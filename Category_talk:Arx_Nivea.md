## Keeping the area uncharted

I've decided to keep this area uncharted. There is a certain thrill in
plunging into the unknown which I wish to preserve for those players who
value exploration, and this is my primary motivation. I do have a number
of others, though. For example, the difficulty in finding the rewards in
the area is a large factor in justifying the rewards available.

If there is any information you think ought to be made public then do
please email me at <qismat@outland.org>, or send me an in-game personal
[note](note "wikilink"). I would also value any feedback or suggestions
you may have.

## Lockers and Lords

The priestess in the river is still there, but she no longer sells
sigils. However, the translucent magister in the tower of Arx Nivea will
sell sigils to those that are brought to him by the area's magical
defences. --[Iktinos](User:Iktinos "wikilink") 22:02, 21 May 2014 (EDT)

    | A priestess has moored her floating shrine |
    | upon the Moonkiss River, which feeds into  |
    | the River Etuan.  She has some of the old  |
    | sigils given to authorised extra-planar    |
    | visitors to Arx Nivea.  Lords possessing   |
    | this sigil should have no trouble visiting |
    | the temple for... enlightenment.           |
