Regarding the discussion about whether races with positive damage mods
can become bld: it plays no part in the prestige. It is strictly based
on whether maxed non-prime dex is higher than maxed str. For example, a
Griffon can gain the prestige and has a positive damage mod.

However, Humans can also become Bladedancers, and their non-prime dex is
equal to their str. Further, Lizardmen have a higher str than dex, and
they can apparently become Bladedancers too.

Is this HELP BLADEDANCERS QUEST going to be in on next reboot? It is not
there now. --[Ylem](User:Ylem "wikilink") 17:00, 18 June 2011 (CDT)
