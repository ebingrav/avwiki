What do you guys think, should we keep all pills, pots, wands and staves
in one category, or should we split them up?

## Brandies

I would add seperate subcats for each

i think keep them together but change the name, that way we can be more
acurate and still have teh same info in one place -elfangwor

Seems like the idea you were going with was lots of seperate pages and
categories -- that's why you have seperate area and gear in area pages.
Might as well stick with that and make them all seperate.  
On a semi-related note, should we have a page for 'junk' stuff? stuff
with no special attributes or useless ones (crappy AC-only gear, create
spring spells, crappy gems, etc.)?

If you want to make pages for items that aren't particularly useful, go
for it. Put them in the "Gear In Area" category, but not in other
categories like "Hero Tank Gear" or "Lowmort 11-20 Gear". That way the
items will be documented but they won't be cluttering up lists where
people aren't really interested in them. -Waite

Is it really neccessary or useful to have things listed in *Brandies* as
well as say *Potions*? Wouldn't it be better to just have them listed
once in the category which best fits them? Also, if you don't like the
name *Brandies*, it would probably be a good idea to change it now,
before it gets worked into too many pages and becomes tedious to change.
On the other hand, an explanation of what a *Brandie* is at the top of
the page would be just as good, though personally I only consider
*Brandies* to be staves. --[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop.md "wikilink")

Yup, I always figured that brandies meant objects that characters can
brandish, not pills and potions and whatnot. I'm all for categorizing
them separately. -DaveGarber1975
