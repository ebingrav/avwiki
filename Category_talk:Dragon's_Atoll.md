In this area you constantly get hit by a sniper - and if you do a 'where
sniper' you can see he is in the area (Sniper's nest). Does anyone know
how to get to him? We've found the "treasure chest" room and how to get
to Myxss for the key/piercer. --[Ylem](User:Ylem.md "wikilink") 09:43,

I don't think there is a way to reach the sniper. I know that during the
area contest, they used explosive arrows, which are probably not
intended to be lootable. Not sure if they still use explosive arrows,
you can try locating for explosive or piercing
arrow.--[Masamune](User:Masamune.md "wikilink") 11:32, 26 April 2007
