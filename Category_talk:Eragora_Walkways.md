i've heard a rumor that there is a catoblepas in walkways that can be
immolated, however i haven't been able to find which one. does anyone
know? it's not the grazing one, is there another somewhere? also, does
anyone know of any other immolate-able mobs in eragora? they need to be
level 26 or less for a hero to immolate them. thanks!

resolved - it's the catoblepas that 'has wandered a long way from home',
usually near the (portable) halfling spy.--[3nki](User:3nki "wikilink")
