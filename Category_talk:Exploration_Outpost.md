The entire top layer is full-safe, and the part on many infirmaries is
true. AFAIK infirms are Gino's room, es (respite), w (mayflower) and 2w
(the room Mayflower takes you prior to dumping you). Next time I cross a
cleric over I'll recheck and write down. --

I checked with my prs, only Respite is an infirm.

Ah, then this must have been changed recently, within the last month or
so. I've been there in early December and all were infirms I believe.
Thanx! -- [WinterRose](User:WinterRose.md "wikilink") 13:42, 2 January
