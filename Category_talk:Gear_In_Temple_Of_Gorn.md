Could someone with more knowledge of how to do so please separate this
into a page for the Lord Version and the Mortal Version?

Lord:

-   [White Tunic](White_Tunic "wikilink")
-   [Red Bracer (Temple Of
    Gorn)](Red_Bracer_(Temple_Of_Gorn) "wikilink")
-   [Red Belt (Thorngate)](Red_Belt_(Thorngate) "wikilink")

Mortal:

-   [Red Belt (Midgaard)](Red_Belt_(Midgaard) "wikilink")
-   [Leather Bracer](Leather_Bracer "wikilink")

You've already got a pretty good start. Basically you need three pages
for each item. Here's an example:

[Leather Bracer](Leather_Bracer "wikilink"): the disambiguation page.
Search for "disambiguation" to get some examples. [Leather Bracer
(Lord)](Leather_Bracer_(Lord) "wikilink") & [Leather Bracer
(Lowmort)](Leather_Bracer_(Lowmort) "wikilink"): should be
self-explanatory.

You can use the move feature to rename a page whose title is too
generic. Let me know if you need more help.
