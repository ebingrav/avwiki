[Treasure-Hunting](Treasure-Hunting "wikilink") was created some time
ago as a page for this very information.

[Money](:Category:_Money.md "wikilink") was created as a category for
[money](:Category:_Money.md "wikilink")-[type](:Category:_Object_Types.md "wikilink")
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink"). I originally made it as a
page but decided that it really should be a category instead. Feel free
to categorize any "bags of gold" or whatnot there. Thanks!
