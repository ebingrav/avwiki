I have information for a grandfathered quest weapon called evel's Forked
Tongue. I am wondering if it even belongs on the wiki, because there is
no way to obtain or trade for one (they are bound to owners). Thoughts?

This sounds fine to me. I think of
[:Category:Grandfathered](:Category:Grandfathered "wikilink") as mostly
a curiosity section. Saving the stats and descriptions of an old piece
of quest gear is similar to storing information about a grandfathered
area. Not useful as far as twinking out your chracter, but interesting
nonetheless. [Waite](User:Waite "wikilink") 13:06, 4 December 2006 (CST)
