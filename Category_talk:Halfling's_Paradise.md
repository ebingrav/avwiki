There is one quest in this area, and it terminates in the item "mauve
mollusk mukluks." These are a Fatewalkers equivalent which lack the -mv
penalty. Please do not spoil this quest for the time being, thanks.

  
I'm sure noone will post spoilertastic info, and the maps are also
largely spoiler-free. so no worry Mek. :)
