Thanks for the update on the suggestion - but you mentioned 14/14 or
13/15 weapons. If you go to the suggested weapon page there are no such
weapons. Can you add those weapons to the suggested page?

Unless you mean brilled or dbrilled weapons in which case you should
mention that. --[Ylem](User:Ylem.md "wikilink") 08:15, 29 November 2011

I am more prone to edit it as after the gear, anymore hr/dr is all based
off weapon(s) plus enchants and dependant on what you use depends on the
hr/dr (chain/double hit/dual wield/2-handers) and maybe improving a
shard from 10/10 to 11 or 12 --[Rhodry](User:Rhodry.md "wikilink")

Possible things to add

-   base dr improvement without counting weapons + held is 66 dr
-   state shards/orbs get enchanted 10/10 being the average 11 or 12
    being possible.
-   for bld's and those that use double-hitters some people prefer to
    use gear with a bit of hr on it as well as dr (more hits more damage
    is the rationale).
-   state at 250 wars/bods/etc get double hit and quite alot of people
    prefer to use double hit weapons which will drop your hr/dr (again
    you get more hits so more damage so the dr hit is not meant to
    matter that much from it)
-   bld's use rapiers (or other lightweight piercers) for poisons till
    101 where they can shift to tourachs/avengers due to getting balance
-   paladins use paladin weapons

Theres possibly more and it probably should be added to the hero melee
weapons page with a going there link there, I would do it myself but I'm
having a grammar/creative fail and can't figure out how to put it.

My intent, when I put up the comment originally, was to let people know
what was the un-enhanced improvement they could expect to start with
just getting the best (easily) retrievable gear.

Ah I see it is a bit biased and makes all new players think they have to
have double brilled weapons to run might be best to just revert the
edit. altho I do think the bit about shard/orbs I mentioned could be
added --[Rhodry](User:Rhodry.md "wikilink") 13:47, 29 November 2011

Cleaned up language a little more.
