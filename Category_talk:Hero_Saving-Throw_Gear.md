Feel free to ignore me and delete this post if I'm incorrect about this,
but unless I'm mistaken the [Orb Of The
Shogun](Orb_Of_The_Shogun "wikilink") is incorrectly listed here as
being held when it is in fact a light. Just thought I'd bring it up here
instead of moving it in case you accidentally linked the orb instead of
some other item. Although I guess I could have moved the orb too.
