Still too much? I've been gathering information about the Fae (original
and High) for a while but I think there is only so much we should put up
and leave for the players to find on their own.

I like the highlights. For details perhaps we can refer to specific
locations, items, mobs, or quests where more can be found, without
actually reproducing the exact wording wholesale. Personally, I feel a
short one or two sentence summary is acceptable and may help interested
parties find what they are looking for.
