Is it worth linking this page up to somewhere more accessible, to
encourage pointing people in the right direction if they feel like
filling in gaps? Main Page somewhere?

On the main page there is a link to "Contributing". I'll add a link
there. --[Ylem](User:Ylem "wikilink") 12:04, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
