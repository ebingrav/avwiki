How about a list of the low-mort insignia quests in level order?

That sort of already exists, as you can go to [:Category:Lowmort 1-10
Quests](:Category:Lowmort_1-10_Quests "wikilink") etc. and sort the
table by Reward Type. (I just noticed that two of the level ranges don't
have tables yet, which I'll do at some point).

There doesn't seem much harm in having a long list here, even if it gets
quite long, so I've added the early quests. There are a lot of quests
after ::level 20, as you wander into Tiurrees/Graw levels, so maybe
leave 21\~30 until 31\~40 and 41\~50 are done?

I suggest that once the insignia listed get their own entry, we remove
them from the list to avoid needless and unwikified
duplication.--[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop.md "wikilink") 03:03, 2 October

Badge of Mutation, while having several different versions, is
essentially a questless, effectless insignia. We can probably just stick
all the types on a single
page.--[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop.md "wikilink") 03:03, 2 October 2011

Diplomatic Corps insignia probably do not need a different page for each
ambassador. Though, it could be good to differentiate between the normal
type and the remort race type. Though, perhaps just have two sections on
the same page. --[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop.md "wikilink") 03:03, 2

Some insignia come from the same quest, but have different names, and in
some cases different effects. Should these be listed seperately? Should
they be listed as different subsections of the same page? I'm guessing
the latter option would be
easier.--[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop.md "wikilink") 03:03, 2 October 2011
