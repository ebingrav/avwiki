Thinking we don't really need to have a link to the area quest category,
and to the quest itself on the same page. Probably mimic the way that
tickets are done, and just have a link to the area, then from there to
the quest. The insignia themself are listed under the
[insignia](:Category:_Insignia "wikilink") page, so there are further
links there. --[Shadowtop](User:Shadowtop "wikilink") 03:12, 2 October
