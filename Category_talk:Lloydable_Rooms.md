Missing: Above the queen in Astral, anything in airscape?

I'm pretty sure the entrance to Nothing is the Lloydable room in each
elemental plane. [Waite](User:Waite "wikilink") 22:04, 20 February 2009

The lloydable room in [Airscape](:Category:Airscape "wikilink") is
called **A Thin Wisp of Cloud**, and in
[EarthRealm](:Category:World_Of_Stone "wikilink") it's called
**Elemental Plane of Earth**. I don't know directions to them though,
and I don't believe there's any real use to them, other than going to
[Nowhere](:Category:Nowhere "wikilink"), and even then going through
[Water](:Category:Plane_Of_Water "wikilink") is probably a better
option. Room names from nexuses in
[Nowhere](:Category:Nowhere "wikilink").
