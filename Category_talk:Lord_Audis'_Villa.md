Anyone know who the [ticket](Audis_Family_Crest_(Ticket) "wikilink")
goes to or how to get into the treasure room?

The ticket is part of bci quest. As for the treasure room, just pull the
painting. The door is unbashable, unpassable and unpickable from both
sides and will shut behind you. [Rhodie](User:Rhodie "wikilink")

I tried that but while I can look at it ("The first Lord Audis stares
out of the painting, seemingly following the movements of everybody in
the corridor.") when I tried to push/pull it I get "That isn't here." It
might be because I'm a lord. Will have to try with a hero.

Might need rogue lore or alertness. [Rhodie](User:Rhodie "wikilink")

Must be a BCI - my hero 1 rogue (with rogue lore practiced to 95) still
could not do anything with the painting. --[Ylem](User:Ylem "wikilink")

[Alertness](Alertness "wikilink") perhaps?

Practiced up to 90. --[Ylem](User:Ylem "wikilink") 11:23, 18 December

Ok - I was informed that alertness is something you have to toggle on.
With it on I can get into the painting. Thanks!
