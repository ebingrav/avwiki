Im useless at tables but couldn't we edit this table so its similar to
the lowmort weapon tables EG column for name, weapon type, damage type,
hr, dr, kdr, ac and comments, then make the appropriate columns
sortable? --[Rhodry](User:Rhodry "wikilink") 14:48, 5 May 2011 (CDT)

I'll take a look when I have time. ^^ [Caoimhe](User:Caoimhe "wikilink")

i like the latest table mod but it would've been nice to keep the Tier
rating as a column.--[3nki](User:3nki "wikilink") 12:00, 6 May 2011
