maybe we should add a note about different hitting classes liking
different things. for example some want hr and dr, some only care about
dr. for these the "most effective" piece of gear may be
different.--[3nki](User:3nki.md "wikilink") 00:47, 30 August 2011 (CDT)

TBH I didn't really see the point in this page anyway as the 1-10
hitgear, 11-20 hitgear, etc pages sort of already have this info and you
can work out the progression yourself.

@Rhodry The ranged pages answer the question, "What is the best item
available for slot x in level range a-b?" I created the progression
pages to answer the question, "What is the best item available for slot
x at my level?" As a level 28, for example, I found myself flipping
between the 21-30 and 31-40 pages and opening all the items listed on
those pages to "work out the progression \[myself\]." I created the
progression page based on my efforts so others don't have to go through
the same effort if they don't want to.

@3nki Yeah, I worked these out from the \[hit\|arc\|tank\|mana\]gear
pages and I was going to make separate hitroll/damroll progression pages
eventually but then real life got in the way. A note explaining that all
the info is sourced from the ranged pages might be good so anyone who
looks at this knows what definition is being used for "most effective".
