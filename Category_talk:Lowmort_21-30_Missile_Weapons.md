Ok, here is something someone can help with: there are no longbows
appropriate for a level 30 archer, and it's a question because that's
when it starts becoming really hard to solo with an archer, so, any
advice? The next level set of missile weapons includes nothing
appropriate for a level 30 archer. --[Arcano](User:Arcano.md "wikilink")

This spot used to be filled by [Scorpion's
Sting](Scorpion's_Sting "wikilink"), but that's gf'ed now. After a quick
scan of the info here, the best option I could find was the [Hunting
Long Bow](Hunting_Long_Bow "wikilink"). It only provides 7 hr, but
better than nothing. Does anyone know if the imms ever made a
replacement to [Scorpion's Sting](Scorpion's_Sting "wikilink")? This is
just a guess, but maybe there's something in [Shadow
Forest](:Category:Shadow_Forest.md "wikilink").

I coulda sworn that there was a replacement for the Sting. Maybe in one
of the piratey areas? 7hr vs 12hr isnt that big a deal at this level;
and besides, Archers shouldnt solo with longbows
anyway.--[Kerdor](User:Kerdor.md "wikilink") 13:28, 8 February 2007

*that's when it starts becoming really hard to solo with an archer*  
Ok so i guess I was unclear but I was looking for a longbow because they
hit the hardest and don't mess up all the times like a crossbow.  
I ended up going with an enchanted bow Starlight, and 5 hr is more of a
difference at low levels than it is at
hero.--[Arcano](User:Arcano.md "wikilink") 14:06, 8 February 2007 (CST)

Longbow AND Heavy crossbow both suck for soloing. Period. Use a light
Xbow; or even a short bow. Especially enchanted light xbows. Works just
fine.--[Kerdor](User:Kerdor.md "wikilink") 14:16, 8 February 2007 (CST)

I was looking for a longbow to take advantage of the hitting power of
archer and find someone to tank me, becuase at that point it was slow to
solo even with a good set of wields or a light xbow, due to extremely
low damage, but perhaps I was doing something wrong. It was not
impossible, just very tedious.--[Arcano](User:Arcano.md "wikilink")
