disregard my request for suggestions on
[Category_talk:Areas](Category_talk:Areas "wikilink"). Just follow my
lead if you wanna help hook these maps into the wiki

Okay fine do it this way i don't care. It does look kind of funny to
have every page in this category start with the word Map. So the only
subsection is M. then M cont. Etc.--[Mel](User:Mel "wikilink") 12:34, 3

Good point. Maybe I'll change it to "Barrier Wastes Map" instead of "Map
Of Barrier Wastes"

## Downloading Problems

I just downloaded three [Houses](:Category:_Houses "wikilink") area
maps. Avatar Wiki put a / in each of their filenames and I can't figure
out how to get rid of these /s. Can you? Or are they required to be
there for some reason? Thanks much! --[Dave

## Program used to make maps

What program was used to make these maps?

For [Laboratory Of Chalmus Map](Laboratory_Of_Chalmus_Map "wikilink") I
used [Dia](http://live.gnome.org/Dia) along with [the
GIMP](http://www.gimp.org) to do the rotated text. If you're on windows
Visio would be a good fit. I'm not sure what Skyrider & the gang use.

Paper and pencil and then [Paint.Net](http://www.getpaint.net)
