The comment in this (*Boss mob is one GIANT plant.*) seems to indicate
that there is a giant plant somewhere. But I have not seen it. I've
found a **large iron key** but no door that needs it. Anyone more
familiar with this place? I've found the summoner but there was nothing
down there but him. Did I miss something? Anyone?

Yeah, you know, I created this area, and It's not exactly one of the
best ones out there. It was my first attempt at building, and I
misjudged my time, so near the end of the building contest, I was kind
of rushed.

It was loosely based upon an old science fiction book called Deathworld,
by Harry Harrison, where all of the animals and plants had been affected
by a psionically powerful being, that made them all hyper-aggressive.

I got the idea of an outpost, besieged by aggressive animals, plants and
insects, down pretty good. In the novel, there is a part where a giant
plant actually breaches the wall, allowing tons of animals to enter the
outpost, which happens in the north part of my area. My idea was, the
plant is so large, that tendrils actually extend into the adjacent
rooms.

The idea of the psychic being kind of got rushed at the last minute, and
is the summoner underneath the area. As for the key, I can't answer
that, because in the contest, we did not create any objects or quests.

Given the opportunity, I would love to go back and rework this area.

Well I'll put up the map later this weekend of what I have. You can tell
me if I missed anything. --[Ylem](User:Ylem "wikilink") 00:13, 6
