Someone mapped this, long ago. How'd they get in? I don't know where the
key is! It's so frustrating, if anyone knows please let me know.

From the entrance (where the locked door is) you can go east, north,
west. The room description has the line "*If you take a close look, you
can see there is a hinge in the ledge.*" If you 'look ledge' you get:
*The small ledge offers protection from both sun and rain, both of which
are often used by Tannah to experiment on the surroundings. You notice a
hinge in the ledge, and as you look even harder you also notice a tiny
lever, and you wonder what would happen if you push it.* However I do
not seem to be able to open it - pushing on the following resulted in
nothing: lever, tiny, hinge, ledge, obsidian, it.

I edited the main page with instructions on how to get inside. If you
find the other copy of the key in [Desiccated
Farmland](:Category:Desiccated_Farmland.md "wikilink") please update the
[Key To The Gate](Key_To_The_Gate "wikilink")'s page.
