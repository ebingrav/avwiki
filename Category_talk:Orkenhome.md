Corrected the directions to locate to City of Orkenhome. Before it had 1
south missing so it missed when you ran.

Thanks, Lazyfresh! A number of walking directions to areas, mobs, and
such, located in areas connected to The Ruins of Reveria are slightly
innacurate at present. This is because these directions were based upon
information obtained from a slightly-flawed map of Reveria's ruins.
Partly for this reason, I am about to post a new and (hopefully)
accurate map of these ruins. If I find time and if nobody else does so
first, then I will soon verify all other sets of directions in this
region's areas. Thanks again! --[Dave
