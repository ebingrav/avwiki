I was curious about pets - is there any real use for them other than
good for a few levels? They don't gain XP during fights so they don't
level. If they die they're gone. I was hoping for some sort of companion
that will level with me but it just seems only for a few levels then not
really worth it. Is there any hero level pets? The highest I've found is
45 (war elephant). Just curious. Thanks!

I'll ask again because I'm curious. Is there any hero-level pets?

## Maximum Pets

I just noticed that my lord could have 4 pets, not 3. Maybe the maximums
have changed? Maybe it is actually class based?
