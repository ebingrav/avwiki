This was a first stab at a table to display race options for each
prestige class. Of course, remort races can be nearly any prestige
class. All of the information might not be correct, such as druid and
mnd races. I am not completely sure whether hel and hor get an arc
bonus, and I don't know all of the races that get a psi bonus.

Few thoughts:

-   I might be mis-reading this table but it looks like Giants can
    become Fusiliers (the intersection of the column/row is green). This
    might need to be looked at.
-   Additionally the top row takes you to the spell/skill page for the
    class. Would it be more helpful to take it to the actual class?
-   Lastly, this information might be more helpful to put a list of
    races that can be that class (or not) on each prestige class page
    rather than this large chart here. I would assume most people, when
    doing research for a class, will go directly to that class page and
    want all the relevant information there.

Thanks for the input. I think the giant info might be incorrect because
of clipboard inheritance when I was creating the table. You are right, a
link to the actual class would be better. I am not sure why I linked to
the skills and spells. I agree that adding the prestige options to each
class page and possibly also to each race page too would be better. I'll
work on that. --[Morgul](User:Morgul.md "wikilink") 10:23, 2 May 2007
