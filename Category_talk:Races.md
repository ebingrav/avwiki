Ok.. same thing for Races and Classes as what I just did with Areas.
Want me to do these as well?  
I mean, they're only supposed to be under ascension races, creatable
races, remort races etc instead of under Races as well. Same for prc's
and remort classes under classes. --[Llanor](User:MooNFisH "wikilink")

Sounds great, thanks for your work. I'll add areas, races, classes, and
gear to the navigation panel. [Waite](User:Waite "wikilink") 15:14, 15

Done. --[Llanor](User:MooNFisH "wikilink") 16:41, 15 May 2007 (CDT)

Added a new highlight color for unusually good stats (demonseed dex,
faerie wisdom, goblin/kobold TNL) both so they stand out as above and
beyond the normal range, and so the more normal races' 3rd best values
can stand out like they should. --[Neyne](User:Neyne "wikilink") 21:24,
