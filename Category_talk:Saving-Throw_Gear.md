does anyone actually care about saving throws?

It is a category page. Does it even matter if anyone does or does not?

Not really, but I was curious. --[Arcano](User:Arcano "wikilink") 11:45,

Saving throw is useful when you fight mobs that cast nasty spells. One
example where it's useful is when fighting the [Ultimate
Dragon](Ultimate_Dragon "wikilink"). Extra saves definitely cut down the
damage you take from his breath attacks. [Waite](User:Waite "wikilink")
