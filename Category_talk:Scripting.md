Just curious, I have some scripts that some might find useful, but
pasting them in makes them all ugly. What is the best method for putting
this type of thing up? Can you attach a file to a page and then upload
it?

Thanks, Jekyll

You can try the "Upload file" link, which should appear on the left of
the screen under toolbox. But IIRC there's a limitation in the wiki
software that only allows you to upload images and sound files. Talk to
[Melanarchy](User:Mel.md "wikilink"), chances are he'll host them for
you somewhere else, and then you could link to them from here.

You need to use a template CLICK EDIT AT TOP OF THIS PAGE. LOOK AT WHAT
I DID BELOW and you'll see what i mean. just copy the one i made below
and fill in your stuff. If you don't edit it. You can't really see
what's going on!

## NAME OF SCRIPT

Write in what your script does here.

## IMPORTANT README

Any real important notes you want people to read about the script. It
can be as much as it needs to be i usually go to about here then start
the next line!

## CODE

    place your code here
    in between the pre things
    and it will stay how you put it
    #even the pound signs.

## CONTACT INFO
