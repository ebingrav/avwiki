The sanc guide doesn't buy keys, does he? I thought people just give it
to him, and they'll show up in his inv, like with any other shopkeep.

That's my impression. --[Ylem](User:Ylem.md "wikilink") 07:30, 2 October

That's right, he won't buy keys from you, but he'll take them for free.
The trick is that he'll sell them back to you. I thought this was
something special about the guide. Do all shopkeepers behave this way?

Yes, but many players use the sanctum guide (like the lord mob) so other
player's can have hard to get keys, or buy them if needed for a CR or
something. --[Arcano](User:Arcano.md "wikilink") 20:33, 2 October 2007

Is this hero and mortal casters only? --[3nki](User:3nki.md "wikilink")
