It didn't seem like the spawning was related to killing mobs, as the
group cleared the entire area (save the big dragons). The QP run was
attempted during the daytime (game-time). After needing imm assistance
to get the Jade Dragon to spawn to retrieve QP, I ventured back on a
large rogue during the night (game-time). There is an invis mob that
shows as glowing eyes, and it moves around the area. After 'following'
it for a while , the Jade Dragon appeared.
