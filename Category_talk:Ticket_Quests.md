just in questioning the format of this section:

as a player who really likes exploring to me these pages seem too
specific.

I would much more prefer one page which actually gives a more verbal
description, containing the info where to start the quest, or where to
learn about it, which areas it spans and such. and then a link to
another which would actually contain the info given here straight away,
the objects and paths.

I was just thinking the same thing. Perhaps you could make the exact
details available in a subsection, but it'd be nice if there was just
some very basic info on the quest, where to start and such as the first
thing you see. They are pretty fun to figure out for some people, so I
think the specifics should definately be seperated in some way (marked
as spoily or such). -[PirateHero](User:PirateHero.md "wikilink")
