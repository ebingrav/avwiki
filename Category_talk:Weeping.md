I'm pretty sure the proper name of this area is "The Weeping", but
cannot verify, so if someone can feel free to move the category.

Also, in reference to my comment about the ticket, I don't know what
this wiki's policy is around revealing "secrets". I don't remember
anymore where that ticket goes, but if someone does and it agrees with
policy, please edit it in. --[BladeBreak](User:BladeBreak.md "wikilink")
