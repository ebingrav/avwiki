so the part about wizards "deal more spell damage" than mages - is that
aside from getting more mana? the damage of disintegrate for example is
more when cast by a wzd than a mag of same race/worship/etc? i always
thought it was just referring to getting more mana, but i could be
wrong.. --[3nki](User:3nki.md "wikilink") 19:33, 24 January 2013 (EST)

  
From what I've seen wizard and mage damage is identical. Wizards get
more mana so they can surge longer, maybe that's what Waite meant.

The low end of my maelstrom damage range was \*\*\*DEMO as a lord mag
gno bhy. When I switched to wizard, it become oblit. My HDL went up by
one asterisk or so as well. [Waite](User:Waite.md "wikilink") 09:24, 25

that's interesting, when i prestiged to wzd at hero 3 i thought my
disints were doing a little more dmg but i figured it must just be
random. good to know. --[3nki](User:3nki.md "wikilink") 12:06, 25
