*Seeing you, this [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink") bows and greets you
warmly. "Welcome, friend. I'm so glad that you've come to help us to
reclaim [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") from the darklin!
Pardon my being a bit distracted but I thought that I may have just
glimpsed a forest [dragon](Dragons "wikilink") fly overhead. I'm told
that [one](Verdissis "wikilink") has settled in a hidden lair somewhere
northish of us in [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink"). A few
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") believe that she may be responsible for
our two missing fighters but most here seriously doubt this--although
she does have a voracious appetite for unicorn flesh, she has never
dared to attack [elves](Elves "wikilink") or
[lizardmen](Lizardmen "wikilink") or such before, unless they've
attacked her first. Anyway, if you can manage to track down [ranger
Leah](Leah "wikilink") in [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
sometime, I'm sure that she can tell you much more about
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s
[dragon](Dragons "wikilink") problems than I can. Quite a few
[dragons](Dragons "wikilink") live by my herd's home, too, in
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink"). I was there only a few days
ago when I heard that my cousin here in
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") had been severely injured in
a darklin attack--and, so, I galloped here to help her. Well, in any
case, I'd best resume my archery practice now; that silly [Westwood
centaur](Centaur_Assassin "wikilink") over there just beat me in a
little contest, but I'm gonna try to best him in a rematch. I'll show
him what a [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink")
[centaur](Centaurs "wikilink") is capable of! And then I'll show those
horrid darklin critters, too." And, at that, she grins mischievously,
laughs, wheels about, and trots off with a happy swagger in her step.*
