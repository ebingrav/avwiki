*As you look at this [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink"), he canters up to
you and gives you a hearty hello. "I'm so sorry that you missed it! Our
[Khoridvar friend](Khoridvar_Archer "wikilink") over there challenged
both me and [a centaur archer](Centaur_Archer "wikilink") from
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink") to join her in an impromptu
archery contest and... guess what?! I WON! I WON, I WON, I WON!!! Look
out, darklin, here I come! Yeeeeeee-haw!!!" And, having said that, he
starts to romp about exuberantly some more, holding his hands up high
and kicking his rear hooves up into the air with joy. You almost can't
help but laugh at his silly antics. He seems to be well aware of how
silly he must seem right now to you but feels too merry to care about it
one bit.*
