*A [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink")
[berserker](:Category:_Berserkers "wikilink") looks up at you and says,
"Oh, dear [Werredan](Werredan "wikilink"), not another! Sometimes, I
think that [Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink") must have asked every
willing and able-bodied forest-dweller from [the
Qanza](:Category:_Qanza_Prairie "wikilink") to
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink") to come and fight with us.
Oh, well, we'll probably need every single one of them, though, if we're
ever to reclaim [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") from those
cursed darklin. They seem to be everywhere in
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") now and they just keep
expanding their presence day by day. Every
[centaur](Centaurs "wikilink") who sets hoof outside of these walls must
now live in constant fear, it seems. All but our boldest must stay off
of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s trails for fear of their
lives. Some wandering bands have taken shelter in [crumbling underground
ruins](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Westwood "wikilink") or [abandoned
villages](:Category:_Centaur_Camp "wikilink") under constant threat of
attack, some [centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") have abandoned their
woodland dwelling-spots and fled to seek refuge with those few of us who
live full-time here in [this
hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow "wikilink")... Well, I don't need to
tell you how tough it's been for all of us
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink"). Please forgive my feeling a bit angered
for a moment there about having to patch together some more
mattresses--really, I'm delighted that you answered
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink")' plea for help."*
