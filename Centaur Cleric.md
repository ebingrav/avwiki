*A [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink")
[cleric](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") looks over at you and asks, "Do
you like our cavern home here? You and some of our other guests here are
the first non-[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") in countless generations
to have visited this special place. But, of course, these are such
unusual times. Last time I remember seeing so many beings here, they
were all [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") who gathered here at our amphitheater to
discuss rumors about unfamiliar dark insectoid beings sneaking about our
woodlands. Those were days when WE wandered
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s trails with confidence
while THEY struggled to keep their presence hidden from us--and, now, it
is entirely reversed. How I yearn for this conflict to end and peace to
return to these woods. I'm so glad that you have come to help us! Please
make yourself at home here among us and enjoy our hospitality until
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s darklin are merely a
memory."*
