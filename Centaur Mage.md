*A [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink") [mage](:Category:_Mages "wikilink")
beams at you and exclaims, "Oh, wonderful! Another fighter! It seems
that [ranger Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink")' invitations have gone
far and wide. I'm so pleased that so many have responded to his call! I
actually traveled here to [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") in
response to an even earlier call for help in fighting the darklin--one
from [ranger Leah](Leah "wikilink") that caught the attention of my
brave uncle, [Silvermane](Silvermane "wikilink"), and that brought him
and my grandfather, [Jenony Whitemane](Jenony_WhiteMane "wikilink"), and
me here, among others. [Jenony](Jenony_WhiteMane "wikilink") has since
taken charge of establishing [a
camp](:Category:_Centaur_Camp "wikilink") in northwestern
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") to help support
[Silvermane](Silvermane "wikilink") and other
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink"). I've found my purpose in
trying to rouse [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s
peace-loving centaur herd to join in this fight to reclaim their home,
which has not been nearly as hard as I initially suspected. And, now,
several of them, along with many of their friends and neighbors, are all
gathering here to form this sylvan militia. I'm so excited that,
sometimes, I can hardly contain myself! Soon, we shall turn the tide
against these darklin and [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
will be safe once more! I'm feeling just giddy with excitement." And,
with that, he twirls about and starts to romp about some more.*
