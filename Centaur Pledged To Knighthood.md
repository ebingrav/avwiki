*Sir Ulysses Surehoof was endowed with a pure but restless spirit and,
as soon as he was able, he dedicated himself to the path of
[knighthood](:Category:_Paladins "wikilink") and then, not knowing if or
when he would ever see his home again, he set out to travel throughout
the world and to fight evil wherever he might find it. After hearing
rumors of the darklin menace while sojourning in
[Solace](:Category:_Town_Of_Solace "wikilink"), he hastened to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") to lend his sword to
defeating them. His companions enjoy hearing his colorful accounts of
faraway lands and seeing his small collection of curious trinkets from
them. His most cherished possession, however, is a simple family
heirloom, which is his only tangible reminder of his distant home and
family.*
