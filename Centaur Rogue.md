*A [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink") [rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink")
trots right up to you and says, "Well met, friend, and welcome to [our
secret hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow "wikilink")! Since
[Leah](Leah "wikilink") summoned [Silvermane](Silvermane "wikilink") and
those other [rangers](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") to help fight our darklin
foes, they have been doing wonderfully, but still not well enough to
turn the tide against them. It's about time that we
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") organized ourselves and fought to
reclaim our home. Once, I used to roam about
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s paths without fear; but,
now, I've had to take refuge here in [our ancestral
hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow "wikilink") like so many others of our
herd. I'm not very well versed in combat--in fact, few of us
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") are yet--but we've all been learning to
fight quickly here. I'm more of an actor, myself. Why, I once played the
notable role of Chironos Skytrotter in our amphitheater just over there
to the east. Oh, how I wish that you could gathered here with the rest
of our herd to see it!" And, having said that, he commences to recite a
few dramatic lines in [Faerie](Faerie_Language "wikilink") for your
enjoyment before wandering away.*
