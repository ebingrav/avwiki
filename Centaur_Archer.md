*Seeing you, this [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink") bows and greets you
warmly. "Welcome, friend. I'm so glad that you've come to help us to
reclaim [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") from the darklin!
Pardon my being a bit distracted but I thought that I may have just
glimpsed a forest [dragon](Dragons.md "wikilink") fly overhead. I'm told
that [one](Verdissis.md "wikilink") has settled in a hidden lair
somewhere northish of us in
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink"). A few
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") believe that she may be responsible
for our two missing fighters but most here seriously doubt
this--although she does have a voracious appetite for unicorn flesh, she
has never dared to attack [elves](Elves.md "wikilink") or
[lizardmen](Lizardmen.md "wikilink") or such before, unless they've
attacked her first. Anyway, if you can manage to track down [ranger
Leah](Leah.md "wikilink") in
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") sometime, I'm sure that
she can tell you much more about
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s
[dragon](Dragons.md "wikilink") problems than I can. Quite a few
[dragons](Dragons.md "wikilink") live by my herd's home, too, in
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink"). I was there only a few
days ago when I heard that my cousin here in
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") had been severely injured
in a darklin attack--and, so, I galloped here to help her. Well, in any
case, I'd best resume my archery practice now; that silly [Westwood
centaur](Centaur_Assassin.md "wikilink") over there just beat me in a
little contest, but I'm gonna try to best him in a rematch. I'll show
him what a [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink")
[centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink") is capable of! And then I'll show
those horrid darklin critters, too." And, at that, she grins
mischievously, laughs, wheels about, and trots off with a happy swagger
in her step.*
