*As you look at this [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink"), he canters up to
you and gives you a hearty hello. "I'm so sorry that you missed it! Our
[Khoridvar friend](Khoridvar_Archer.md "wikilink") over there challenged
both me and [a centaur archer](Centaur_Archer.md "wikilink") from
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink") to join her in an
impromptu archery contest and... guess what?! I WON! I WON, I WON, I
WON!!! Look out, darklin, here I come! Yeeeeeee-haw!!!" And, having said
that, he starts to romp about exuberantly some more, holding his hands
up high and kicking his rear hooves up into the air with joy. You almost
can't help but laugh at his silly antics. He seems to be well aware of
how silly he must seem right now to you but feels too merry to care
about it one bit.*
