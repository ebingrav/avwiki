*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[berserker](:Category:_Berserkers.md "wikilink") looks up at you and
says, "Oh, dear [Werredan](Werredan.md "wikilink"), not another!
Sometimes, I think that [Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink") must
have asked every willing and able-bodied forest-dweller from [the
Qanza](:Category:_Qanza_Prairie.md "wikilink") to
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink") to come and fight with us.
Oh, well, we'll probably need every single one of them, though, if we're
ever to reclaim [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") from those
cursed darklin. They seem to be everywhere in
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") now and they just keep
expanding their presence day by day. Every
[centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink") who sets hoof outside of these walls
must now live in constant fear, it seems. All but our boldest must stay
off of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s trails for fear
of their lives. Some wandering bands have taken shelter in [crumbling
underground ruins](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Westwood.md "wikilink") or
[abandoned villages](:Category:_Centaur_Camp.md "wikilink") under
constant threat of attack, some [centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") have
abandoned their woodland dwelling-spots and fled to seek refuge with
those few of us who live full-time here in [this
hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow.md "wikilink")... Well, I don't need
to tell you how tough it's been for all of us
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink"). Please forgive my feeling a bit
angered for a moment there about having to patch together some more
mattresses--really, I'm delighted that you answered
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink")' plea for help."*
