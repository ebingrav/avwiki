*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[cleric](:Category:_Clerics.md "wikilink") looks over at you and asks,
"Do you like our cavern home here? You and some of our other guests here
are the first non-[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") in countless
generations to have visited this special place. But, of course, these
are such unusual times. Last time I remember seeing so many beings here,
they were all [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") who gathered here at our amphitheater
to discuss rumors about unfamiliar dark insectoid beings sneaking about
our woodlands. Those were days when WE wandered
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s trails with confidence
while THEY struggled to keep their presence hidden from us--and, now, it
is entirely reversed. How I yearn for this conflict to end and peace to
return to these woods. I'm so glad that you have come to help us! Please
make yourself at home here among us and enjoy our hospitality until
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s darklin are merely a
memory."*
