*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[mage](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink") beams at you and exclaims, "Oh,
wonderful! Another fighter! It seems that [ranger
Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink")' invitations have gone far and
wide. I'm so pleased that so many have responded to his call! I actually
traveled here to [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") in
response to an even earlier call for help in fighting the darklin--one
from [ranger Leah](Leah.md "wikilink") that caught the attention of my
brave uncle, [Silvermane](Silvermane.md "wikilink"), and that brought
him and my grandfather, [Jenony
Whitemane](Jenony_WhiteMane.md "wikilink"), and me here, among others.
[Jenony](Jenony_WhiteMane.md "wikilink") has since taken charge of
establishing [a camp](:Category:_Centaur_Camp.md "wikilink") in
northwestern [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") to help
support [Silvermane](Silvermane.md "wikilink") and other
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers.md "wikilink"). I've found my purpose in
trying to rouse [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s
peace-loving centaur herd to join in this fight to reclaim their home,
which has not been nearly as hard as I initially suspected. And, now,
several of them, along with many of their friends and neighbors, are all
gathering here to form this sylvan militia. I'm so excited that,
sometimes, I can hardly contain myself! Soon, we shall turn the tide
against these darklin and [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")
will be safe once more! I'm feeling just giddy with excitement." And,
with that, he twirls about and starts to romp about some more.*
