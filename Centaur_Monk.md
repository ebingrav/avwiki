*A [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink") [monk](:Category:_Monks "wikilink")
notices your gaze and looks up from her activities. "I'm sorry, but all
is not ready to eat yet," she says to you. "But, if you have a moment,
would you kindly take those potatoes out to [Konk](Konk "wikilink")?
Ever since his [elven](High_Elves "wikilink") master Kemenvarno
disappeared, [Konk](Konk "wikilink") has spent nearly all of his time
standing outside of our gate, waiting patiently for Kemenvarno to
return. Although his heart is even bigger than his stomach, poor
[Konk](Konk "wikilink") must be famished by now. I sure hope that our
two missing fighters will turn up soon. I'm rather enjoying having such
an unusual number of guests staying here, including so many
non-[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink"), despite all of the extra work that
it brings us, but I wish that it were under better circumstances. Well,
[Gorn](Gorn "wikilink") willing, here's to happier days ahead!" And, at
that, she returns to preparing a hearty feast big enough to feed an
army.*
