*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[monk](:Category:_Monks.md "wikilink") notices your gaze and looks up
from her activities. "I'm sorry, but all is not ready to eat yet," she
says to you. "But, if you have a moment, would you kindly take those
potatoes out to [Konk](Konk.md "wikilink")? Ever since his
[elven](High_Elves.md "wikilink") master Kemenvarno disappeared,
[Konk](Konk.md "wikilink") has spent nearly all of his time standing
outside of our gate, waiting patiently for Kemenvarno to return.
Although his heart is even bigger than his stomach, poor
[Konk](Konk.md "wikilink") must be famished by now. I sure hope that our
two missing fighters will turn up soon. I'm rather enjoying having such
an unusual number of guests staying here, including so many
non-[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink"), despite all of the extra work
that it brings us, but I wish that it were under better circumstances.
Well, [Gorn](Gorn.md "wikilink") willing, here's to happier days ahead!"
And, at that, she returns to preparing a hearty feast big enough to feed
an army.*
