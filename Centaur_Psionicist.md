*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[psionicist](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") waves hello and
greets you pleasantly. "I thank [Shizaga](Shizaga.md "wikilink") that
you have come, my friend! Not only for me but on behalf of my dead mate
and our daughter. Those accursed darklin attacked us three in a glade
one day and only I survived, barely, and sometimes I wish that I had
not. But, when I meet those darklin again, I hopefully will not be so
ill-prepared as we three all were that day. After they both died and it
grew clear to my herd that it was no longer safe for any of us to roam
about [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") alone, I reluctantly
chose to abandon our simple woodland home and to flee here to safety.
You will learn many such stories if you should linger among us long
enough. Thankfully, at last, we are preparing to fight back! Now, if
only we could figure out why our fighters have begun to vanish. Everyone
here has become deeply concerned about this matter, especially [ranger
Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink"); I don't think he'll rest until
he learns what became of them. Well, I apologize if this may seem rude
but I must excuse myself now--I have so much practicing yet to do if I
am to be ready when we march. Happy trails 'til next we meet, my
friend."*
