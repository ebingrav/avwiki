*A [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink")
[psionicist](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") waves hello and greets
you pleasantly. "I thank [Shizaga](Shizaga "wikilink") that you have
come, my friend! Not only for me but on behalf of my dead mate and our
daughter. Those accursed darklin attacked us three in a glade one day
and only I survived, barely, and sometimes I wish that I had not. But,
when I meet those darklin again, I hopefully will not be so ill-prepared
as we three all were that day. After they both died and it grew clear to
my herd that it was no longer safe for any of us to roam about
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") alone, I reluctantly chose to
abandon our simple woodland home and to flee here to safety. You will
learn many such stories if you should linger among us long enough.
Thankfully, at last, we are preparing to fight back! Now, if only we
could figure out why our fighters have begun to vanish. Everyone here
has become deeply concerned about this matter, especially [ranger
Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink"); I don't think he'll rest until he
learns what became of them. Well, I apologize if this may seem rude but
I must excuse myself now--I have so much practicing yet to do if I am to
be ready when we march. Happy trails 'til next we meet, my friend."*
