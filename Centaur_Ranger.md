*This [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink")
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") standing before you appears to
be in charge of all that is going on within [this
hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow "wikilink"), and you think that you
hear a fighter nearby call him Silvanus Wayfinder. He appears to be too
lost in weighty thoughts at this moment to notice you, which may be good
for you, since he had not invited you to come join his makeshift militia
gathering here in this secret hollow. "Oh, what I would give to find our
missing," he muses to himself, "or else to know for certain of each of
their fates. If some enemy has done this, then may that evil being or
beings receive swift justice for their crimes."*
