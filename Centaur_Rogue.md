*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") trots right up to you and says,
"Well met, friend, and welcome to [our secret
hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow.md "wikilink")! Since
[Leah](Leah.md "wikilink") summoned
[Silvermane](Silvermane.md "wikilink") and those other
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers.md "wikilink") to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") to help fight our darklin
foes, they have been doing wonderfully, but still not well enough to
turn the tide against them. It's about time that we
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") organized ourselves and fought to
reclaim our home. Once, I used to roam about
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s paths without fear; but,
now, I've had to take refuge here in [our ancestral
hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow.md "wikilink") like so many others of
our herd. I'm not very well versed in combat--in fact, few of us
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") are yet--but we've all been learning
to fight quickly here. I'm more of an actor, myself. Why, I once played
the notable role of Chironos Skytrotter in our amphitheater just over
there to the east. Oh, how I wish that you could gathered here with the
rest of our herd to see it!" And, having said that, he commences to
recite a few dramatic lines in [Faerie](Faerie_Language.md "wikilink")
for your enjoyment before wandering away.*
