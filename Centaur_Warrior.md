*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[warrior](:Category:_Warriors.md "wikilink") grins at you and says,
"Salutations, friend! Here amidst all of this peace and beauty, it can
be easy to forget what terror and destruction lie beyond these
protective walls. But it was so different not very long ago. My uncle,
[Achilles Firmflanks](Older_Centaur_With_Dim_Eyes.md "wikilink"),
retired to [these ancient woods](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") not
long before the darklin first showed themselves here, and he bade me
come here to help him in fighting them. He's now off somewhere helping
to defend some other [centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") and to protect
some of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s endangered
unicorns, while I've been helping to get this militia here ready for
battle. Most of these [centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") know combat
only from books, so it's been a difficult project for me, but they've
been very willing pupils under present circumstances. Those
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers.md "wikilink") that
[Leah](Leah.md "wikilink") summoned have been doing phenomenally, but it
hasn't been enough, and it's become clear to this herd and to others in
this region that they need to join in this fight. Anyway, I'd be
delighted to teach you anything that I can; after all,
[practice](Practice.md "wikilink") is essential to develop
[skills](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink"), and
[skills](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") are key to our victory."*
