*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[wizard](:Category:_Wizards.md "wikilink") barely notices you here, as
she seems to be deeply absorbed in whatever it is that she is reading.
"Welcome, friend," she eventually says, "feel free to browse around this
room as much as you like--but I warn you not to touch anything in it
unless you are asked to do so. So many of these
[items](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") in here are priceless, both to
me and to the rest of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s
[centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink") herd, and are well-protected from
would-be thieves, not to mention those who may feel overly curious. In
any case, don't let my words of warning scare you away--I am indebted to
you that you have come here to aid us in our fight against those evil
darklin that are both killing our friends and destroying our forest
home. May [Shizaga](Shizaga.md "wikilink") bless you for your
sacrifice."*
