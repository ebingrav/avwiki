    The natives of the Outer Planes are subject to energies unlike anything
    found within Midgaardia.  These energies can collect within individual
    beings in mystical loci known as chakras.  As monks and shadowfists
    progress in power, they can develop abilities that allow them to control
    the flow of energy through the different chakras.

    The following table shows the benefit one receives when each of their
    different chakras are empowered:

    Blue:   spell power
    Green:  resistance to certain types of damage
    Purple: melee power
    Red:    damage roll
    White:  armor class
    Yellow: damage soak
