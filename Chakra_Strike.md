    syntax:   qi strike <target> <color>
        or    qi strike <color>

    With this ability, a Qi adept can strike out at one of her foe's chakras
    in an attempt to remove the energy from it.  Striking an empowered chakra
    results in more damage to the enemy than does a strike against
    an unpowered chakra.

    Depending on the amount of energy contained within the chakra, it may
    be completely or partially neutralized by the blow.

    Use of this technique requires 1 Inner Qi.
    This skill causes radiant damage.
