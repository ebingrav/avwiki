*As you gaze upon the alchemist Chalmus, it becomes painfully clear that
the good magician has lost his mind. The robes that he wears are filthy
and stained. He looks as if he hasn't bathed or shaved in weeks. Chalmus
doesn't react to your presence at all. You do not know if he realizes
that someone else is in the room. He seems completely fixated upon some
insignificant piece of metal on the floor. While at first glance you
thought that he was simply mumbling gibberish to himself, open closer
inspection it seems that Chalmus is continuously intoning alchemic
spells. The small nugget of metal in front of him constantly changes
shape as Chalmus works his gentle magic. Considering his mental state,
you think that Chalmus would perform just about any work of alchemy for
you if he were given specific instructions and the right ingredients.*
