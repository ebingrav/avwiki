## Comments

This mob's wield is cursed, has an inventory flag, and is poisoned with
[Necrotia](:Category:_Necrotia "wikilink"). Immaculate, detonate, &
shatterstrike are your friend when facing these guys.

Also note that he casts [Shard Storm](Shard_Storm "wikilink"). This is
particularly rough on small casters when you enter the det portion of
the [Unravelling](:Category:Unravelling "wikilink").
