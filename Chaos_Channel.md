*As everyone knows, a magic user's [combat
spells](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Harm_Mobs.md "wikilink")
channel internal energy into deadly elemental attacks. Experienced
combat mages are capable of harnessing the energy of the chaos of battle
and using it as a fuel source for these attacks. This can effectively
halve the [mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink") cost of these spells,
although the technique is very exacting. The caster must be involved in
combat, but not under direct attack. The spell must be a
[Hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") or lower
[level](Level.md "wikilink") attack spell using internal energy. The
technique cannot assist in casting spells based on mental, kinetic,
Demonic or Godly power, or in casting spells altered by other magical
skills, such as [surge](Surge.md "wikilink") or
[quicken](Quicken.md "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Quicken](Quicken.md "wikilink"),
[Surge](Surge.md "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).

This [skill](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") is invaluable
for [mage](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink")
[hitters](Hitters.md "wikilink"), allowing them to roughly halve their
[mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink") usage during runs.
