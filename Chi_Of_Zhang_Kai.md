*The destruction of the Tree Demon has released Zhang Kai from his*  
*1000-year imprisonment, and his Chi stands here, ready to depart*  
*to a higher plane of existence. Such is his reward from the gods*  
*for his service in the name of the Tao.*  
*Zhang Kai says 'Worthy adventurer, you have defeated the Great*  
*Evil, and for that we of the Order of Tao praise you. I have an*  
*item upon me which has great power; if you prove yourself to be*  
*worthy yet again, this will be my parting gift to you.**

## Comments

The Chi of Zhang Kai is in the same room as either the [liberated
soul](Liberated_Soul.md "wikilink"), or the [tormented ghost of a
newbie](Tormented_Ghost_Of_A_Newbie.md "wikilink"), who will assist
against heroes. I don't know why one mob pops instead of another.
