*Created from pure dreams, the chimera don't really exist. They are
figments of the Fae imagination. Here, in Arcadia, that makes them very
powerful.*

## Comments

Typical of the mobs in this area, the Gnome is probably the largest,
along with the dragons (one says Death will thank you, the other says
trip to the cloud). Like many mobs in Arcadia, he casts area spells and
hits fairly hard. Worth about 280-350 solo.
