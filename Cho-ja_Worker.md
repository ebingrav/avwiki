*Vaguely reminiscent of an ant, apart from it being 6' tall. This cho-ja
seems broad and stocky relative to its height. The abdomen has four
three-jointed legs and is surmounted by a smaller upper thorax, roughly
comparable to a man's torso, with two almost human arms. His flesh is
encased in shiny black chitin. The face is oval, with multifaceted eyes
like metal, above two slits where a nose should be. The cho-ja's jaw and
mouth are surprisingly human in appearance, and emits high-pitched
whistles and clicks. It seems to have a placid demeanor, to the extent
of ignoring you.*
