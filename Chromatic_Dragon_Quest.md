Quest to colorize a dragon is the same for every color and for reverting
back to default (red) dragon.

Are you hero level 250 or higher? You have the ability to change your
color:

1.  Your goal is to locate Quixoltan's Temple, which is connected to the
    [Ancient Bronze Wyrm](:Category:Ancient_Bronze_Wyrm "wikilink")
2.  Once there, initiate the quest, which is a simple combat versus a
    solitary mob. Your Bane.
3.  You will be cleared of all affects and gear, and will have to regear
    and respell yourself.
4.  The combat is difficult. See everything written for [Ultimate
    Dragon](Ultimate_Dragon "wikilink") since Bane is very much a dragon
    and most definitely tougher than UD after you reach superhero.
5.  Loot the corpse, give back the proof to Quixoltan's cleric, and you
    are done.
6.  Pick a color.
