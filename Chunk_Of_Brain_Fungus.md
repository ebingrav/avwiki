*Brain fungus is so called for two reasons. One is that it has the
uncanny appearance of actually looking like a brain. Some kind of
puffball, instead of growing spherically, it has the ridged appearance
and grey-pink colour of a brain. The second reason it has its name is
because it is reputed to only grow when it is nurtured on rotting
brains... and from sentient species adept at magic at that.*
