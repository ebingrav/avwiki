*Voinar, son of Barol, Clan Chief of the surface dwelling dwarves of [Mt
Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink") was a legendary hunter in his
youth. Trophies of successful hunts adorn the walls of his cabin and he
bears the scars of these hunts upon his forearms and face. Considered
rash in his youth, age has given him a kind of calm which is reflected
in his demeanour.*
