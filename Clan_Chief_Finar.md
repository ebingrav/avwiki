*Finar, son of Ronar, Clan-Chief of the subterranean
[dwarves](Dwarves.md "wikilink"), wearer of [the Horned
Helm](Horned_Helm_(Mt._Durr)‎.md "wikilink"), vanquisher of the dreaded
[Garm](Garm.md "wikilink") stands before you. Proud titles, though Finar
is in fact an ordinary [dwarf](Dwarves.md "wikilink") to behold. Stout,
tall and hearty with a full grey beard and more scars than he'd care to
remember, with an easy going nature. He is well loved by his people and
rarely has to repeat his softly spoken commands. His one great regret
was allowing the rivalry with [Voinar](Clan_Chief_Voinar.md "wikilink")
to escalate - once like brothers, they haven't spoken in years...*
