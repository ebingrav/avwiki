*Meeting a [Sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers "wikilink") is, at best,
rather unpleasant. Those who fight against them retain scars burnt into
their very souls, and are often reluctant to face them again. This
discipline focuses that effect, making it painful for enemies to
remember a [Sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers "wikilink") while trying to
track one after a battle. Many simply call off pursuit rather than face
the pain. [Sorcerers](:Category:_Sorcerers "wikilink") can maximize this
effect by being as generally unpleasant as possible.*

Prerequisite(s): [Demonic Intent](Demonic_Intent "wikilink"), [Tainted
Genius](Tainted_Genius "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
