*Meeting a [Sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink") is, at best,
rather unpleasant. Those who fight against them retain scars burnt into
their very souls, and are often reluctant to face them again. This
discipline focuses that effect, making it painful for enemies to
remember a [Sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink") while trying
to track one after a battle. Many simply call off pursuit rather than
face the pain. [Sorcerers](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink") can
maximize this effect by being as generally unpleasant as possible.*

Prerequisite(s): [Demonic Intent](Demonic_Intent.md "wikilink"),
[Tainted Genius](Tainted_Genius.md "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
