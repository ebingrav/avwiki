*Gray and dull, the only thing notable about echostone is a thin aura of
blue light around it, and the fact that it is always warm to the touch.
This particular clump of echostone glows noticably stronger, and its
surface is flecked with tiny silvery filings. The heat from the stone is
palpable.*

## Comments

The sailor is in the hold of the derelict ship that sometimes appears in
the Rim. Key to him is on the captain.

The -3 con can be alleviated, and is inconsequential on maxed out
heroes, while the extra saves always come in handy.
