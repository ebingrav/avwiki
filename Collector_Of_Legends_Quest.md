This is one of the quests done in [Rim](:Category:Rim "wikilink").

Goal is to gather various lore in form of writing that corresponds with
the four sea deities:

-   Muo Wishene - the whale <spoiler>Get *message in the bottle* from
    the western wreck in Rim Proper.

Take it to Sailor's wife in Shizaga's Temple. Get a poem titled 'Things
I have never promised'.</spoiler>

-   Crattenos - the shark <spoiler>Captains journal is found on the
    ghostly ship's captain, no subquest required. Break through the Fog,
    get to the Pocket of Cool Water, and wait patiently for the ghostly
    ship to appear. Consult map to see where it will spawn. It is
    believed the ship spawns at night or at some specific weather, or a
    combination of both. More info is required.</spoiler>
-   Lumoloth - the kraken <spoiler>Get to the Lost in the Wreckage
    minimaze. One room has a hidden chest, so read carefully until you
    find it. Open it and grab the shipping logs. Take these to Lord
    Audis in his Villa, and when he tells you go to his Library to grab
    the Legend of Lumeil.</spoiler>
-   Mnephrikos - lord of the dead <spoiler>The "King" of New Thalos
    wants news from New Thalos, as he clearly states. Go to New Thalos,
    get the news from New Thalos and give him the said news. Feel free
    to murder him repeatedly afterwards. Many, many times.</spoiler>

Tickets are difficult to find, each requires either a small subquest of
its own or is hidden in relatively inaccessible location. Once gathered,
give them to the questgiver on the other side of the fog. <spoiler>The
questgiver is the Sea Priestess in the same boat as the Explorer for the
other ticket quest. She is located in the Pocket subarea and she will
give you a ticket to deliver.</spoiler>

Follow the plotline to Gorn's Anchor, and grab the award: the [Aura Of
The Storyteller](Aura_Of_The_Storyteller "wikilink") and the [Compendium
Of Island Mythology](Compendium_Of_Island_Mythology "wikilink").
<spoiler>Simply deliver the collection of legends to the Sea priestess
in her temple at Gorn's Anchor to complete this quest.</spoiler>
