Syntax: c 'commune'

There comes a time in each adventurer's life where the lesson is learned
that allows strength to be drawn from the
[aspects](:Category:Aspects.md "wikilink") themselves. By communing with
an [Object of Power](:Category:Objects_of_Power.md "wikilink") under
their faction's control, a sufficiently powerful user can gain great
boons. These boons will fluctuate depending on the
[Object](:Category:Objects_of_Power.md "wikilink") and its underlying
[aspect](:Category:Aspects.md "wikilink").
