Syntax: c 'commune'

There comes a time in each adventurer's life where the lesson is learned
that allows strength to be drawn from the
[aspects](:Category:Aspects "wikilink") themselves. By communing with an
[Object of Power](:Category:Objects_of_Power "wikilink") under their
faction's control, a sufficiently powerful user can gain great boons.
These boons will fluctuate depending on the
[Object](:Category:Objects_of_Power "wikilink") and its underlying
[aspect](:Category:Aspects "wikilink").
