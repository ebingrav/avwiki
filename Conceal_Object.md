Prerequisites: [Illuminate](Illuminate "wikilink")  
Syntax: cast 'conceal object' <item>

An incantation and focus of inner strength can twist light and dark to
wrap an object into invisibility. This also removes the glowing nature
of items. Be careful for what you wish for, however. An invisible item
tends to not like to stay where you want it. Use this spell at your own
risk.
