*Having seen better days, an old looking yet sturdily built man in light
armor carrying a staff surveys the oat fields. Conian is trying to bring
back balance to this island's ecology, which was quickly being destroyed
once sailors and travelers drove the tortuga's from the ocean into the
once lush mangrove stands on the island. He quickly understood some
drastic measures were involved in regaining a natural cycle which would
last beyond his years. Intending to leave this cay in harmony with
itself and the ocean is the legacy he works towards.*

*Living as a hermit has taken its toll and he almost didn't notice you.
Suddenly as if stuck by seeing the sun he beams a smile and strides
towards you. "Stranger, Your arrival here is very timely. Perhaps you
could help mewith a problem I am having trouble dealing with? You see I
am trying to keep the confidence of these tortuga who consider me to be
a savior to them when in all honesty I must destroy some of their young
to keep them from being able to eat this crop of oats I have been
planting. My magic can no longer keep them dormant long enough in the
tunnels which I convinced them to dig when I first arrived here seeking
to protect them from poaching. They are quite safe now but I have
disrupted the natural control of their population by teaching them that
they can hide in the coral reefs if they dig tunnels into them. I must
make this right but I cannot risk allowing the tortuga here to walk all
over the field. You can help me by trying to control the booming size of
their expansion or even killing their mother leader whom they bring oats
to in her tunnels. I hope I can count on you." Looking like a broken
spirit this ranger pierces your heart with his plea for help.*
