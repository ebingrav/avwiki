Conquer is a solo ritual that can be performed within a team's base at a
node. Completing the ritual gains your team control of that base. Once a
single team controls all of the nodes, that team wins the Epoch and the
Legend realm is renewed.

Enacting the ritual can be dangerous as it takes a significant amount of
time to execute and leaves the player vulnerable during that time.
Should the ritual be interrupted in any way, the build up of power is
broken and must be attempted again in order to gain control of the node.
Once a node is successfully conquered, all existing mobs in the area
will slowly decay and die. Once dead, they will then be replaced by mobs
allied with the conquering team.

Control over nodes allows teams to draw on their power with
[Commune](Commune "wikilink"). Control also provides a shortcut into a
nodes area through the halls of the controlling teams base.

Conquer show will allow a member of a team to see which nodes their team
controls.
