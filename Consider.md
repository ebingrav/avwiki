Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character. Of
course, it's only a rough estimate.

The following is a list of roughly what the messages will be, with the
exception of extremes...but with luck, you won't try to fight those.

    why bother              not difficult               difficult
    no sweat                a bit smaller               lucky day
    with ease               perfect match               serious hurt
    no match                could hurt                  laughs mercilessly
    easy kill               a bit bigger                you're foolish
    not hurt                a lot bigger                you're kidding

NOTE: Sometimes consider tells you that it's an easy kill, and then the
mob kills YOU with ease. That's due to the random chance built into the
program. Hey, everybody gets lucky sometimes. ;)

## Comments

When first starting out, or the first time entering a new area, a player
should CONSIDER every mob before a fight. Remember that there is always
the possibility of an errant message, but for the most part, stick to
mobs that fall between "a lot bigger" and "serious hurt" for the best
risk versus reward.
