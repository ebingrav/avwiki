*This has seen better days. Being buried for the gods only know how long
has certainly not done this piece of ancient battle gear much good. It
would take someone of considerable skill to deal with the damage time
has wrought.*

## Comments

This lowmort item has the same AC as [Willowmail
Leggings](Willowmail_Leggings "wikilink"), but many other bonuses as
well. It is gained through a *very* difficult battle that should not be
attempted by those smaller than superheroes.

Please note that the saves are *positive*, thus worsening the
resistances.
