## Comments

There are some aggressive mobs in Tainted Isle on the way to this mob.
Before venturing down from the eye of the storm (the "3d" part of the
directions below), sneak and move hidden should be sufficient to keep
from being attacked; after this point, speedwalking may be best. Some of
these rooms that one must pass through to get to this guardian may be
private, which may be a problem for characters traveling in groups.

Note that, just below this guardian's room, one may find even tougher
mobs (one level 85 sanced not aggy or no detect, and one level 95 not
sanced aggy), good experience, and some interesting gear ([Glowing Heart
Of Tainted Isle](Glowing_Heart_Of_Tainted_Isle "wikilink"), [a writhing
lash formed of tainted
darkness](Writhing_Lash_Of_Tainted_Darkness "wikilink") (9/11 single
handed whip)) .
