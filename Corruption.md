*Choose wisely if you want to head further down the path of Sorcery.
Once you commit yourself and become a corrupt soul, you cannot turn
back. The result is a chance of shrugging off feeble
[curses](Curse.md "wikilink") due to their lack of power compared to
your already cursed life. It also has the added benefit of preventing
foolish [clerics](:Category:_Clerics.md "wikilink") from
[blessing](Bless.md "wikilink") you.*

Prerequisite(s): [Curse](Curse.md "wikilink"), [Demonic
Intent](Demonic_Intent.md "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
