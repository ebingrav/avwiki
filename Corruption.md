*Choose wisely if you want to head further down the path of Sorcery.
Once you commit yourself and become a corrupt soul, you cannot turn
back. The result is a chance of shrugging off feeble
[curses](Curse "wikilink") due to their lack of power compared to your
already cursed life. It also has the added benefit of preventing foolish
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") from
[blessing](Bless "wikilink") you.*

Prerequisite(s): [Curse](Curse "wikilink"), [Demonic
Intent](Demonic_Intent "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
