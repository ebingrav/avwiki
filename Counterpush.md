*The result of a successful counterpush is quite similar to the shield
[bash](Bash.md "wikilink") [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink"); the
foe is knocked down, off balance and less able to defend. This counter
is somewhat draining on the [Monk](:Category:_Monks.md "wikilink")'s
defenses.*

Prerequisite(s): [Bash](Bash.md "wikilink"),
[Counter](Counter.md "wikilink").

Syntax: [ctr](Ctr.md "wikilink") push.
