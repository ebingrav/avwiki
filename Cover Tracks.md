*Those adept at following tracks learn a trick or two when called upon
to obscure their own. The use of this
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") can throw off pursuers who are
following the user after a battle. The odds of success are based upon
the victims' [race](:Category:_Races "wikilink") and
[class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink"). Beasts and
[Psions](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") are particularly hard to
lose. It only works on enemies who are hunting a player, not currently
fighting, and in the same [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") (but not
the same [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink")) as their target.*

Prerequisite(s): [Woodcraft](Woodcraft "wikilink").

Syntax: cover tracks.
