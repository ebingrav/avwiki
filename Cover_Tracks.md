*Those adept at following tracks learn a trick or two when called upon
to obscure their own. The use of this
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") can throw off pursuers who are
following the user after a battle. The odds of success are based upon
the victims' [race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") and
[class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink"). Beasts and
[Psions](:Category:_Psionicists.md "wikilink") are particularly hard to
lose. It only works on enemies who are hunting a player, not currently
fighting, and in the same [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") (but
not the same [room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink")) as their target.*

Prerequisite(s): [Woodcraft](Woodcraft.md "wikilink").
