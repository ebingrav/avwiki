Lvl 85 wight and three lvl 80 crawling arms in this room

An Ashy Cinerarium \[Exits: down\] Hundreds of urns lay shattered
throughout the room. The ash contents contribute to the dust already
hanging in the air. Teeth and broken pieces of urn pottery lay about,
crunching under the feet of any occupants of the room. (Black Aura) The
wight draws in life from everything around it. (Black Aura) A severed
arm appears to be thumb wrestling with a lifeless arm. (Black Aura) A
severed arm has been animated by necromancy. (Black Aura) A severed arm
pushes rocks around.

The bloating and discoloration of this arm means it probably came from
some unlucky drowning victim. A crawling arm is slightly scratched. You
peek at the inventory:

`    [Pristine  ] (Glowing) (Humming) a glowing arm bone`

The tattoos on this arm seem to indicate it once belonged to a sailor of
some sort. The arm's flexing as it crawls still makes the lewd tattoo
move in interesting ways. A crawling arm is in perfect health. You peek
at the inventory:
