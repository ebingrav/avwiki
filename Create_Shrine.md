Prerequisites: none Syntax: cast 'create shrine'

You can create a temporary shrine at the right location. Once made, it
makes the room an [infirmary](:Category:Infirmaries.md "wikilink").

Once the shrine's power fades, it crumbles into ruins. The remains still
have some power, however, and a new shrine won't be able to be produced
until the remains turn into dust.
