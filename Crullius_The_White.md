*Crullius was once a principled, wise man but has slowly been corrupted
by his own power. Lately he has noticed that his opposition grows
stronger while his forces dwindle. He knows that if the Darks are able
to ally themselves with the terrible beasts that have crawled forth from
the abyss, then all is lost. He has secretly been in contact with
Arcanthra, guaranteeing himself a position on whichever side wins.*
