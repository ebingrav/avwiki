*The counter or ctr [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") is used
to juggle the [Monk](:Category:_Monks.md "wikilink")'s arsenal of
counterattacks. Typing ctr with no argument (or only invalid ones) will
show you your current counterattack setting. The following are valid
arguments for attack type: [hit](Counter.md "wikilink"),
[kick](Counterkick.md "wikilink"), [trip](Countertrip.md "wikilink"),
[disarm](Counterdisarm.md "wikilink"),
[push](Counterpush.md "wikilink"), [throw](Counterthrow.md "wikilink"),
shatter, crush. Simply entering the name of the
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") you wish to use will cause you
to use that [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") until a counter
occurs, at which point you will switch back to standard [counter
hits](Counter.md "wikilink"). The stay argument will cause you to
continue using the selected [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink")
until you deliberately change it. The off argument will simply turn off
all counterattacks until you re-enable them.*
