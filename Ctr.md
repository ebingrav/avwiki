*The counter or ctr [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") is used to
juggle the [Monk](:Category:_Monks "wikilink")'s arsenal of
counterattacks. Typing ctr with no argument (or only invalid ones) will
show you your current counterattack setting. The following are valid
arguments for attack type: [hit](Counter "wikilink"),
[kick](Counterkick "wikilink"), [trip](Countertrip "wikilink"),
[disarm](Counterdisarm "wikilink"), [push](Counterpush "wikilink"),
[throw](Counterthrow "wikilink"), shatter, crush. Simply entering the
name of the [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") you wish to use will
cause you to use that [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") until a
counter occurs, at which point you will switch back to standard [counter
hits](Counter "wikilink"). The stay argument will cause you to continue
using the selected [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") until you
deliberately change it. The off argument will simply turn off all
counterattacks until you re-enable them.*
