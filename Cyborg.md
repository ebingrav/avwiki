## Comments

While only used by Immortals for testing character skills/spells, this
race was granted to one player (Cyboar) as a temporary boon during a run
back in 2007. The TNL was observed during the run. The race is
apparently not no-fail based on spellcasting witnessed at the time.
Otherwise the race remains inaccessible, along with pit fiend,
insectoid, merman, devil, ghost, and miscellaneous others.
