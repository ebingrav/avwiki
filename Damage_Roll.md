*What goes better with a good [weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink")
than a good damage bonus? The Damroll stat is the extra damage done
(above and beyond the computer-generated number) when you succeed in
hitting a creature. There are many pieces of
[equipment](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") scattered about which
[augment your natural damroll state](:Category:_Hit_Gear.md "wikilink");
[identify](Identify_(spell).md "wikilink") everything! Note this,
however: you won't be able to see your damroll stat until a certain
[level](Level.md "wikilink").*

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may view their damage
roll using their [score](Score.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink").
