*Dark Forge is a ritual of 3 Sorcerers on an item resting on the ground
between them. Through their reforging using a black incantation, an item
can be raised to a level close to the Sorcerer who ends the chant. The
cost of this can be considered a cleansing as well as a taint since any
previous enchantments are removed and it becomes impossible for "good"
to wear them.*

*NOTE#1: The last to cast determines the new level.*

*NOTE#2: Test this on a worthless item to see the level change.*

Prerequisites: None

Syntax: c 'dark forge' <object>

When cast on a spirit's of eragora gaunt: This is a special item. It
resists your attempt to reforge. (It is bound to a player via quest or
insurance.)
