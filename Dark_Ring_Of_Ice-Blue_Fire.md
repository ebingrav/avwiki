*Sizzling heat cracks and pops in one corner of the room. The same color
as the lightning-blue torches that line the walls, this flame seems to
be the mother of them all. It stands tall, at the ready to strike at any
moment if anyone comes to close. Every few seconds, a line of fire
curves away from its body, seeking something or someone to scorch,
before retreating back to the safety of the centralized flame. The fire
turns dark for a moment, a purplish hue that seems to swallow the
surrounding stones.*
