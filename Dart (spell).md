*The Dart [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") is the most basic
kinetic attack. The [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") takes an
[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") from the caster's inventory and
flings it with great force against the body of the enemy. The
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") then falls to the ground.
[Items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") which are too heavy for the
caster's mind to handle (as determined by
[intelligence](Intelligence "wikilink")) cannot be darted, and
[container objects](:Category:_Containers "wikilink") also cannot be
used, as they are too unwieldy to hurl properly. There are no
reimbursements for [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") lost with this
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink")...*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'dart'
\<[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink")\>.

The dart spell uses telekinesis to hurl an item from your inventory at
the mob you're currently fighting. Dart cannot be used to start combat.

The heavier the item is that you're darting, the more damage it deals.
You can only dart an item with weight less than or equal to your current
intelligence. Also, you cannot dart
[Containers](:Category:Containers "wikilink").

The item that is darted is the one that is at the top of your inventory.
In other words, it is the item that you most recently picked up. As
mentioned above, dart will never throw a
[Container](:Category:Containers "wikilink"). If the top item of your
inventory is a container, then dart will select the next available item.

Dart is a truly amazing spell when you first gain access to it. By
utilizing dart, a properly prepared psionicist can expect to do damage
up to (or exceeding?) \*\*\*PULVERIZING\*\*\*! However, dart is not as
easy to use as some other damage spells. To dart safely you will need to
have a clean inventory, with all your useful gear stored in
[Containers](:Category:Containers "wikilink"). See [Gear Changing
Aliases](:Category:Gear_Changing_Aliases "wikilink") for a couple
examples of how to maintain a neat & tidy inventory.

Losing the item you use to dart can be very traumatic for a young
psionicist. To avoid this, follow these three easy tips:

-   Don't fight mobs who are scavengers. They may pick up your dart
    fodder while you're in spell lag
-   Etch your dart object with a unique keyword
-   Make a simple alias. The following example assume that you etched
    your dart object 'tickler':

` alias dart c dart:get tickler`

Unfortunately dart is the best psionicist damage spell until
[Torch](Torch_(spell) "wikilink"), which you can't learn until level 34.
As you level up you may find dart's damage to no longer be adequate for
your needs. At this point many psionicists begin using
[Quicken](Quicken "wikilink") in conjunction with dart. This is
particularly useful for this spell since dart costs so little to cast.

Here's some nice heavy low-level items that can be used with dart. Feel
free to add to this table.

**Suggested [Objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") to Dart**

Also keep in mind that hero psionicists can alter the weight of
equipment slightly via the [Transmute](Transmute "wikilink") spell. Note
that [Transmute](Transmute "wikilink") cannot be cast upon objects with
the [magic flag](Magic_Flag "wikilink").
