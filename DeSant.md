## Comments

DeSant's appears on scan as

`A priest stands here, smiling benevolently and radiating kindness.`  
`   Then he attacks, screaming, "KILL THE HERETIC!"`

His gear is unattainable, except for the key, and is cursed. His key
opens the door to the east. The room is private. Also many a new lvl 25
tank has died due to walking into his room by accident. So stay away
from him!
