*This man is surprisingly young, with eyes full of fire, calculating the
many possibilities afforded to him by the strategic arrangement of maps
and trinkets covering the table's surface. His face cracks into a
vicious grin as you enter the room. Whatever he has planned, there will
be blood...*

## Comments

The Deacon is a priest, capable of healing himself and his two
bodyguards, as well as getting rid of blindness if flashed. The amount
of healing he manages varies greatly, sometimes he heals just one damage
category, and sometimes he is capable of healing from *almost dead* to
*some scratches* instantly.

One of his bodyguards is a mindbender, and the other is a bodyguard, so
you might get tossed or decepted.

Deacon is involved in [Mauve Mollusc Mukluks
Quest](Mauve_Mollusc_Mukluks_Quest "wikilink"). Dying in Deacon's room
to either him or his bodyguards will Auto-CR the player.
