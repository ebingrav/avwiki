*A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of chaotic psionic energy.
Essentially, it applies the same destructive kinetic energies in the
[Detonate](Detonate "wikilink") [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") to
living tissue. Although this energy is not godly in origin, usage of
this [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") may attract the attention of
the god of death, [Bhyss](Bhyss "wikilink"), who has been known to have
a little fun with those who attract his attention.*

Prerequisite(s): [Ultrablast](Ultrablast "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'death field'.

## Comments

This is the most powerful area spell at hero (use to be, now blood nova
is) and has lower lag compared to acid rain, but it has high cost and
can cause you to be affected by [Deaths Door](Deaths_Door "wikilink").
Also, there's a small chance of getting caught in your own death field.
