*A bargain with death, if you can comprehend, takes place with the
magical death shroud you create. While this shroud is upon you, if you
die, your loss of [experience](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") will be
kept minimal. Consider it death insurance to ease your spirit through
the whole ugly process of being killed. (This
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") is
[race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") dependent and will not reduce
your [experience](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") loss to 0.)*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'death shroud'.
