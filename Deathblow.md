*Don't you just hate it when your last attack ALMOST kills an enemy?
[Berserkers](:Category:_Berserkers "wikilink") with the Deathblow Rite
can taste impending victory and gain an automatic extra attack when they
hit an enemy for more than 50% remaining [HPs](Hit_Points "wikilink") in
one blow (ie, for brutality other than terminal). There is no guarantee
the extra attack will connect, or that it will do the same damage.
Deathblow does not loop; the extra attack cannot itself generate
another.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: none (automatic).
