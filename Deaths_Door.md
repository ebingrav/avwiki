''The psionicist who conjures a cataclysmic field of destruction will on
occasion come to the notice of Bhyss, god of destruction, who does not
look kindly upon competition. With the retributive DEATHS DOOR effect,
Bhyss temporarily lowers the maximum HP of an errant psion.

''For any Psion foolish enough to continue risking Bhyss's wrath, the
effect is cumulative.

## Comments

Being affected by Death's Door can temporarily halve your base hp
(repeatedly if you continue using [Death
Field](Death_Field "wikilink")). There's also a small chance of setting
your base hp to 1. Your actual hp isn't affected unless you get "caught
in your own death field", which happens fairly often and can really hurt
if you are surging. Beware of quaffing any healing potions, brandishes
or using any healing spells on yourself while you're affected, since it
will set your actual hp to be equal to base hp if it is more. The
affects of poison or disease will also set your hp.
