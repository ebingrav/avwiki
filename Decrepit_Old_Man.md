*Saying this man was ancient doesn't even begin to describe it. Though
he is a guard just like everyone else, his eyes have lost their luster
and have dimmed against the ravages of age. Though he seems about to
slip on every random ice path, he manages to keep his balance at every
turn. His was an odd story; he was once like the other guards that
patrol these corridors, but something went wrong with the anti-aging
spell Veyah's sorcerer cast on the rest of them.*
