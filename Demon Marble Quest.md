There are two reboot only marbles hidden in the menagerie and gearbox
portions of the vault. These tickets can be turned into the demon
attendant in the labyrinth north of Bo'Vul for either a 5% hp regen or
5% mana regen insignia depending on the marble. The bonuses last for 30
days.

Their keywords are 'brimstone bauble' (hp) and a sulfurous shooter
(mana).
