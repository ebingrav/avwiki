''With the wardgates unbarred and the shackles unleashed, Demon Lord
Typhus is restored to his full power; a true lord of demons, wielding
massive tools of destruction and capable of destroying hundreds of
simple souls with a single blow. Battling such a monstrosity is going to
take all the grit you can muster.

## Comments

Appears in the room Portal from Hell (same room where [The Lord Typhus'
shadow](Lord_Typhus'_Shadow.md "wikilink") pops) when the [Annulation
Device](Annulation_Device "wikilink") is dropped in the center room of
the upper part of [Rise of
Typhus](:Category:Rise_Of_Typhus.md "wikilink") (Guardian Altar, has the
ancient protector that is non-aggie and is sanc'd).

A [Demon Shard](Demon_Shard "wikilink") appears on the ground when he is
killed, and his corpse can be skinned for the [horns of
Typhus](Horns_Of_Typhus.md "wikilink").

If there is already an instance of Demon Lord Typhus in the area when
you drop the Device you will see the same message as usual, and the
Device will be destroyed, but a second Demon Lord Typhus will not appear
â€“ rather, the existing one will be destroyed and replaced with a new
instance in the room Portal from Hell.

Shortly after an instance of Demon Lord Typhus is killed a series of
groups of four demons will appear in the room Portal from Hell (starting
with: "A quasit steps out of a shimmering portal."). Not sure if the
number of demons is always the same or varies. On one occasion there
were twenty demons total, in five groups of four, each of a different
type of demon. They appear in Portal from Hell even if the instance of
Demon Lord Typhus was killed in another room.
