*Demonfire is a cute little demonic spell that clings to a body like sap
from tree. While it seemingly is harmless, it actually **magnifies the
[damage](Damage.md "wikilink") of attacks**. Demons are nasty creatures
and only they would have come up with such a diabolical spell for
themselves.*

*On unsuspecting victims of a demon's wrath, demonfire is a common sign
that the victim is in trouble. It is at that point that a smart
adventurer should run for his or her life.*

Prerequisites: None
