*Gurumondo the Great found the incantation to summon a minor demon to
answer simple questions. The demon seemed more than willing to answer
any question as long as it was simple enough to only require a 'yes' or
'no' in response. Gurumondo was killed several years later. (He supplied
a minor noble with advice so horrible that the noble ended up bald and
with warts covering his nose. Gurumondo screamed while burning at the
stake that it wasn't his fault. That and something about strangling a
demon in the after-life.)*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'demonic advice'.

This [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") has no practical value except
for entertainment, much like a Magic 8 Ball in real life.
