gem.*  

## Comments

To craft with these gems, you will need to see the [Demon
Crafter](Demon_Crafter "wikilink") in the area north of Bo'Vul. You'll
require the [Blood-Mithril Key](Blood-Mithril_Key "wikilink") to get
inside. The key can be purchased from Bo'Vul for 86.4k gold however
first check the pot in Bantu's kitchen to see if a fellow helpful player
has already left one these.

Once you have the key, the walking route from Bo'Vul is \[n\], enter
pentagram, e, s, e, s, e. When you're ready to leave the area, you can
"cast home".

LOOK MENU to see what he has to offer (or see below). Each item can be
modified with two different options. Giving the crafter the [Demonic
Lapis Lazuli](Demonic_Lapis_Lazuli "wikilink") and a [perfect
gem](Perfect_Gemstones "wikilink") allows him to modify things.

Order:

`give lapis demon`  
`give `<item>` demon`  
`say `<customized item choice>  
`give perfect demon`

Base of the final item is 27-30 depending on the perfect gem used and
item is bound to creator.
