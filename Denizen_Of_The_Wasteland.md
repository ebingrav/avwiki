Skin the corpse of the Denizen to get a [Sandblasted
Emerald](Sandblasted_Emerald "wikilink").

The Denizen is a kspawn when you kill the correct [A wild
darkenbeast](A_wild_darkenbeast "wikilink") found in [the flowing
landscape](The_flowing_landscape.md "wikilink"). The correct one has a
room description of "A darkenbeast feeds on a burnt corpse."
