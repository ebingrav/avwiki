*As surefooted as any [dwarf](Dwarves "wikilink") could be on a field of
rocks like this, Derin Stoneaxe carries himself with the seeming
carelessness and calm achieved only by years of fight and hardship. Held
lightly in his leathery hands is [a huge
axe](Stone_Axe,_'Darkness' "wikilink"), haft of shiny metal and head of
black stone. 'Greetings. Alas, I can offer no glowing orbs nor grand
halls. Sure, the sky has its own splendour, but I would prefer the
shimmer of durrite in a vast wall of grey stone any day... Yet, it might
be a while until I can see my family in [Mt.
Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink") again. I had only recently
returned, just to be sent off with those greenhorns of the 'New Guard'
to look for [troll](Trolls "wikilink") scouts. At first I thought it was
a joke, but more and more I realized that something is odd in these
parts of the mountains. Peddlers and Knights have disappeared, and
truly, there has been an increase in [trolls](Trolls "wikilink")
attempting to enter our town further up in the mountains. I wish I had
some fighters with me whom I could trust... But maybe you can help me in
finding out about this new threat - [clan-chief
Voinar](Clan_Chief_Voinar "wikilink") would surely show his gratitude.*'
