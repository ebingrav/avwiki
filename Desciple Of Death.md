Stabs, and the stab carries about 8 ticks of overconfidence + scramble +
psychotia. Even after cure poison + cure diseasing, you will still
shiver and suffer every tick (word of escape will be interrupted).
Ablution will clear that poison + scramble.

Carries "the dagger of death" (one-handed, poisoned piercing weapon,
27/22), a poisoning tool kit, a vial carved from stone (poison), and a
master lockpick.

3 xp, comparable to other planar nexus mobs.
