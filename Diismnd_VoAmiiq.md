*Having just recently finished his training, this makriith, a Riithi
shaman, is now required by custom to provide his services to the noble
caste, until he has reached a new level of personal enlightenment. His
first service was to come along on this expedition/raid to perform the
rites and rituals that would assure blessings and success upon the
venture. It's also his function to seal the way back down to the Riithi
Home Caverns, ensuring no surface dwellers can learn of their location
or the route that leads to them. His eyeless face is covered by a mask
worked into the shape of an elven looking face. His body is covered in a
long gray robe. His chanting voice is very orc-like and gutteral as he
chants and throws some dust into a small brazier.*
