*This man-boy was one of the newer guards to have been "hired" by Veyah
and her minions. In actuality, he came here to spy on their activities
and to try and find some of his neighbors, but he got caught and he lied
his way out of an execution. He spends most of his days trying to assure
himself that he's not a coward, that's he's going to make a stand...
someday. The only answer is the stomp of his boots through the dirty
gray slush of the ice and the rattle of his nerves. No one said being
brave was easy.*
