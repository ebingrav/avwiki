*Looking at the Broo Shaman causes a wave of nausea to pass over you.
Its goat head cackles and chants, and you can see the beginning of a
spell appear in the air in front of it.*

## Comments

There are actually two of these [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"), one
with [a flute](Broo_Shaman's_Flute "wikilink") and one with [a
brooch](Antique_Emerald_Brooch "wikilink") that is used in [Broo
Village](:Category:_Broo_Village "wikilink")'s [Orosca's Enchanted Wrist
Guard Quest](Orosca's_Enchanted_Wrist_Guard_Quest "wikilink"). For those
on [this quest](Orosca's_Enchanted_Wrist_Guard_Quest "wikilink"), it
would be courteous to kill *both* shamans when possible; otherwise, when
[this area](:Category:_Broo_Village "wikilink") repops, it will contain
*two* shamans holding [flutes](Broo_Shaman's_Flute "wikilink") but
*zero* carrying [brooches](Antique_Emerald_Brooch "wikilink").
