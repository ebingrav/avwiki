*Looking at the Broo Shaman causes a wave of nausea to pass over you.
Its goat head cackles and chants, and you can see the beginning of a
spell appear in the air in front of it.*

## Comments

There are actually two of these [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"),
one with [a flute](Broo_Shaman's_Flute.md "wikilink") and one with [a
brooch](Antique_Emerald_Brooch.md "wikilink") that is used in [Broo
Village](:Category:_Broo_Village.md "wikilink")'s [Orosca's Enchanted
Wrist Guard Quest](Orosca's_Enchanted_Wrist_Guard_Quest.md "wikilink").
For those on [this
quest](Orosca's_Enchanted_Wrist_Guard_Quest.md "wikilink"), it would be
courteous to kill *both* shamans when possible; otherwise, when [this
area](:Category:_Broo_Village.md "wikilink") repops, it will contain
*two* shamans holding [flutes](Broo_Shaman's_Flute.md "wikilink") but
*zero* carrying [brooches](Antique_Emerald_Brooch.md "wikilink").
