*Ah, what a busy fight! Everyone is pounding on someone else, magic
ripples through the air - and noone is watching you! How about just
slipping away...*

*Disengage will attempt just that. Instead of joining in the general
mayhem you try to sneak away from combat. Obviously, this will fail if
someone is fighting you directly.*

*The skill relies heavily on your ability to
[sneak](Sneak.md "wikilink") and the
[alertness](Alertness.md "wikilink") of the things going on around you.
A high number of allies fighting improves your chances of sneaking away
successfully, while a high number of opponents increases the chances of
being detected.*

*A group leader using the [Mastermind](Mastermind "wikilink") skill will
noticably increase the odds of succesfully disengaging.*

Prerequisite(s): [Withdraw](Withdraw "wikilink"),
[Alertness](Alertness "wikilink") Syntax: disengage <direction>
