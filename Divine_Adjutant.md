**Syntax: cast 'divine adjutant**'

*Kra was renowned tactician and a brilliant warrior. Her troops
confidently followed her into battle knowing that they were in the
highly capable hands of their trusted leader.*

*The clerics of Kra have been hard at work developing a spell to help
their followers emulate their deity. They have created a spell to imbue
a caster with the powers of a divine adjutant. This will help improve
the leadership talents of the group leader as well as improving the
rescue skill of the caster.*

*This is a powerful pantheon spell. Any single cleric can only maintain
(i.e. be the caster of) one of these spells at any given time.*
