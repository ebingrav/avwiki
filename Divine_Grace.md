**Syntax: cast 'divine grace**'

*Tul-sith is devoted to the art of healing. Many clerics of this deity
ultimately specialise so completely in this art that they become priests
devoted to healing. Some that have remained as clerics have developed
this spell which helps to improve their healing ability. It relies on
the empathy of the caster which means that it will become more powerful
when cast in a group that is in dire need of healing.*

*This is a powerful pantheon spell. Any single cleric can only maintain
(i.e. be the caster of) one of these spells at any given time.*
