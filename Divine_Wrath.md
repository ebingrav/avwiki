`1 'DIVINE WRATH'`

Syntax: cast 'divine wrath' target

Though of unknown origin, many ancient texts suggest that this spell was
commonly used among Tor's Elite. Calling on the will of their god while
vowing the absolute destruction of their enemies, the Paladin will be
granted the ability to tear their foe apart one piece at a time. Causing
this sort of pain is unique in that it starts by destroying the spirit
before radiating to the body.

This use spell requires not only the ability to cast it, but an active
Oath of Destruction.
