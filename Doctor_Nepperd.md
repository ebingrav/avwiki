*Doctor Nepperd, world famous for all the amazing things he has
discovered, has graced this carnival with a visit. In case you have
never heard of his accomplishments, that might be because not many
people have. Yet he claims to have found a cure for ogranism, which is
when your baby looks like an ogre (but isn't!) And he won't let you
forget about his potion against draconica-halata, a super bad case of
garlic breath. You start to believe this guy might be a quack. And maybe
he is. But just hear him out! He has climbed the highest mountain to
find a little plant he calls Neproot. It cures dyslexia. And cold feet.
And nailbiting. And short wingspan. And a lazy third eye. And sunburn.
And so much more, he cannot even tell it all right here and now.
Nononononono! Why don't you just buy a bottle? Or maybe you prefer a
pill? Extract from the Neproot could be yours for just a few gold coins!
Buy now and you can buy another one too!*
