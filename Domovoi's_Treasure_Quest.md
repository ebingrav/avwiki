1.  Start the quest by giving 100 coins to the old weathered beggar in
    Mervue (pp [Banker](Banker "wikilink"), 1s, all w).
2.  Visit [Tainted Isle](:Category:Tainted_Isle.md "wikilink")
3.  Hatch you need to access is on the second layer, under *Deep within
    the undergrowth*
4.  Key to open the hatch is on the [Treasure Seeking
    Adventurer](Treasure_Seeking_Adventurer "wikilink"), on third layer.
    You can murder him for the key and ignore any knowledge he may
    impart (in a true heroic fashion).
5.  There are two levers and a chest in the center. Pull the levers in
    either room, left and right, until you hit a combination that works.
    Chest will open.
6.  Give its contents to the beggar to get 5 Quest Points. The End.

You will also gain the [Finder Of Domovoi's Treasure
Insignia](Finder_Of_Domovoi's_Treasure_Insignia "wikilink").

-   Alternatively, instead of returning to the beggar, go to the mob the
    adventurer mentioned and give him the loot.
-   Give him [Domovoi's Sleeves Of
    Knowledge](Domovoi's_Sleeves_Of_Knowledge "wikilink") to upgrade
    them.

**Note**: You can redo this quest as many times as you wish but the QP
will only be assigned once and returning loot to the beggar again will
have no effect. However, this allows you to upgrade multiple Domovoi's
Sleeves from whatever alt you desire.

Note: This cannot be done on a lord. **You must do this on a hero.**
