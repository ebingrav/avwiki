*The Doom is a thirty-foot-wide sphere of black marble, polished to a
shine and flickering with evil power. It is suspended above a dark pit
by a steel collar around its middle, connected to a dozen thick chains
that rise up into the darkness. The Doom suddenly thunders a voice into
your head. "NOW, YOU DIE."*

## Comments

Whatever you do, don't FLEE from this room as you may well end up 1
down, a no-exit room with a vast number of cockroaches that WILL kill
you unless you're quick to surge an area spell, or hit well. A CR there
is obviously not a simple matter, either. If you need to leave the
Doom's room, calm and teleport out or go west (Eyes, Ears of the Doom do
aggie).
