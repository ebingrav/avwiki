*Although anybody can hold a [weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") in
two hands, it takes extra training to get the most oomph out of your
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink"). This
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") improves damage done while double
wielding. As anyone who tries will soon learn, some weapons simply
cannot be double-wielded. If you find you must have something that you
can double-wield, perhaps it's time to search for a new weapon!*

Prerequisite(s): none (automatic).
