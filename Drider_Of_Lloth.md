There are two of these mobs in
[Necropolis](:Category:Necropolis "wikilink"):

## First Drider

*The most noticeable thing about this drider is the blank, vacant
expression this abomination wears on his face. Smaller than the rest of
his invading company, he sticks near the rear checking for assassins.
Just when his intelligence looks to be in question, one of Veyah's
guards comes closer and all stupidity drains from his drow face. Perhaps
he is just playing the part, attempting to lull the enemy into
complacency?*

## Second Drider

*Scuttling along the torch-lit hall, this drider's spider legs make no
sound amid the muddy puddles and somehow manage not to be caught in the
quagmire's grasp. The upper half of his body - an imprisoned drow,
bastard offspring of one of Lloth's worshipers - crouches low, trying to
hide as he comes around each corner. None of the guards pay him much
mind, as hidden in the shadows as he is, but that just makes his task of
scouting through the area much easier.*

his goal: the altar.
