In the [ancient bronze
wyrm](:Category:Ancient_Bronze_Wyrm.md "wikilink") area, find the the
[Bronze Wyrm](Kastinius.md "wikilink").

Kill [Bronze Wyrm](Kastinius.md "wikilink") and pull the lever that
appears. Note: You can't enter the room with
[Vincent](Vincent "wikilink") without killing the wyrm because the lever
needed to open the door won't appear until the Wyrm is dead. Use an alt
or ask a friend, it's pretty big and it tails/breaths (obviously).

Go north after you pull the lever. You'll find
[Vincent](Vincent "wikilink") and all you have to do is listen to him
talk.

When he has finished talking give him the scroll you got from the MNI
quest, listen to him again, and then you can evolve.

Going NW from Vincent takes you to a portal to exit the cursed/aggie
zone that you're presumably unspelled in.
