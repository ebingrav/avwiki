*It is hard to tell if the Dweller is man or wolf. He is surely some of
both. He has two distinct human hands where his front paws should be,
and most of his human mind is gone to that of an animal. He is now more
wolf than man or Wamphyri. He will not attack you; in fact he shows you
little interest.*

The dweller bites and is poisonous. The talisman around his neck is
simple to get mana gear compared to the other T1 mana items, but
requires fading (difficult) or harmonizing.
