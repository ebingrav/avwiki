*This half-orc hunter is in very bad shape. He's bleeding freely and
gasping for breath. He looks as if he might die at any minute.*  
  
*He looks up as you enter the den.*  
  
*'Please forgive me if I hit you with an arrow,' he gasps. 'I've been
hunting a large troll that killed my family.' He stops to cough, and a
small dribble of blood appears on his chin. 'I ran into some other
trolls and they've about killed me. I crawled in here to get away from
them.' He coughs again. His voice is fainter now, 'Please,' he begs you,
'if you find the troll and kill it for me, and bring me proof of its
death, I will give you a reward which you-' he coughs and wheezes, then
catches his breath. 'Which you might find useful...'*  
  
*He has passed out, his breathing shallow and rapid.*
