*Thousands of years old, Ebrishim formed a pact with the Necromancer.
They are both working towards the same goal of an undead controlled
world. She resents serving the Necromancer but continues to do so to
advance her own agenda, for now. Your intrusion into her inner sanctum
is most certainly not in those plans.*

## Comments

Ebrishim tails, like most dragons, and hits hard. Worth a lot (sometimes
as much as 500) due to virtually never being killed by virtue of its
awkward location (Necro tower basement).
