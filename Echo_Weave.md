''The Echo Weave is a series of moves which may be woven into the
[Unending Dance](Unending_Dance "wikilink"), improving its effects. The
weave adds greater variety and complexity to her dance, making her
movements harder to predict.

As a result, her dance will cause great frustration in archers and
arbelists, whose missiles are often deftly evaded by the bladedancer.

If the bladedancer is in a bladetrance while performing the [Unending
Dance](Unending_Dance "wikilink"), the trance will not merely improve
the dance, and her use of [Ocean Weave](Ocean_Weave "wikilink"), but
also the Echo Weave she performs. Her enhanced intuition will help her
evade incoming arrows and bolts more effectively.''

**Prerequisite(s):** [Unending Dance](Unending_Dance "wikilink")
