*The old man looks back at you. "Perhaps you can help me, and in doing
so help yourself. Many centuries ago, [an item of great
evil](Evil_Crystal "wikilink") was buried within this mountain.
Recently, the [mage](:Category:_Mages "wikilink")
[Saliri](Saliri "wikilink") learned of [this
item](Evil_Crystal "wikilink") and began seeking it. Now he has found
it. [This cave](:Category:_Caves_Of_Ancient_Evil "wikilink") was dug by
creatures which have been enslaved to his will so that he might reach
[the item](Evil_Crystal "wikilink"). If he finds [this
item](Evil_Crystal "wikilink") and learns to tap its power, he will be
unstoppable! You must find and destroy [the
object](Evil_Crystal "wikilink") before this can happen. Bring me [proof
of the item's destruction](Shard_Of_Crystal "wikilink"), and I will
reward you well. Now go! We have little time!"*
