*The whites of this guard's eyes flicker against the blue of the torch
light, as he is constantly scanning, always searching without rest.
Prick him, and he would not bleed; he is a mere shadow of a life,
brought forth by the magic of Veyah and leashed to her every command.
Though he can remember no orders - it has, after all, been a long time -
he still completes his trips around this accursed place with a
relentless monotony that would infuriate even the most dull adventurer.*
