This quest can generate one of three different elemental armbands. This
quest is made difficult by two things. The first being that the mobs
that have the items are invisible to heroes and thus can only be
attacked by area spells/attacks (although you can sleep to get them to
attack you & they show on scan as 'You see red glowing eyes watching!').
The second is that the items dropped are bound to the killer. So going
in a group it may be a while until a person has all three items. The
items are:

-   [Invisible Stalker](Invisible_Stalker "wikilink") drops [Invisible
    Stalker Essence](Invisible_Stalker_Essence "wikilink")
-   [Master Mindflayer](Master_Mindflayer "wikilink") drops
    [Mindflayer's Tentacle](Mindflayer's_Tentacle "wikilink")
-   [Closet Of Cloakers](Closet_Of_Cloakers "wikilink") drops [Cloaker’s
    Tail](Cloaker’s_Tail "wikilink")

The type of the armband given is dependent upon which item you give
[Calsviri](Calsviri "wikilink") first (he'll automatically take the
other two items).

-   Cloaker's tail will get you the [Armbands Of Elemental
    Fury](Armbands_Of_Elemental_Fury "wikilink")
-   Invisible stalker essence will get you the [Armbands Of Elemental
    Harmony](Armbands_Of_Elemental_Harmony "wikilink")
-   Mindflayer's tentacle will get you the [Armbands Of Elemental
    Purity](Armbands_Of_Elemental_Purity "wikilink")

Also be sure and note the alignments on each item and plan accordingly.
Some additional aspects of difficulty are that some mobs here scavenge
items off the ground, so they may pick up your dropped quest item. Also
some mobs here eat player corpses, and if that happens they may pick up
your items as well.

Some more notes: these mobs all flee. Each of the three groups seems to
consistently spawn in a particular region of the area.
