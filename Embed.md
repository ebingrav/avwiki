*Some [characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") have the ability to
embed particular [gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones "wikilink") into
[objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"). If the right combination of
[gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones "wikilink") is embedded into the right
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"), then a player can attempt to
[manifest](Manifest "wikilink") that
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") into something more powerful.*

Prerequisite(s): [Gem Lore](Gem_Lore "wikilink"), [Weapon
Lore](Weapon_Lore "wikilink").

Syntax: embed \<[perfect-gemstone](Perfect_Gemstones "wikilink")\>
\<[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")\>.

Possible outcomes:

**Success**: You embed the gemstone.

**Failure**: You fail to embed.

**Fumble**: The gemstone shatters.

**Catastrophic Fumble**: The item explodes.

If you fail to embed you lose 10% of your practiced ability in this
skill.

It's a good idea to practice embed to adept if you fail an attempt. This
way you minimize your chances of shattering a perfect gemstone.

Lord 800+ warriors have a skill that makes them virtually no-fail, but
in general, the same rules apply to embedding as for
[sharpening](Sharpen_Weapon "wikilink").
