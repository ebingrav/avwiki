*Whatever its appearance, the weight of this material is not that of
silk. Judging alone by the force needed to lift this strange shirt it
could well be metal. But the smooth surface pleases the skin and it
softly drapes itself around your wrists, feeling extremely comfortable.
And the complex embroidery that covers every inch of it sparkles in the
light, as if the brightness of sun or stars was reflected by the
everchanging ripples of the sea. But, though the blue sleeve might be
sensitive to the gentle tracing of a fingers tip, at the merest hint of
violence it turns into a shell too hard to break by force, but for the
wearer still is flexible and soft.*
