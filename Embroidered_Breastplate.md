*Judging alone by the force needed to lift this strange shirt it could
well be metal. But the smooth surface pleases the skin and it softly
drapes itself around your shape to be extremely comfortable and
becoming. And the complex embroidery that covers every inch of it
sparkles in the light, as if the brightness of sun or stars was
reflected by the everchanging ripples of the sea. But, though the blue
material might be sensitive to the gentle tracing of a fingers tip, at
the merest hint of violence it turns into a shell too hard to break. A
metal encasement to keep you safe as if you peacefully rested in a
lovers embrace.*

## Comments

Main advantage over other armors is the weight - being full 25lbs
lighter than [Carburized Steel Plate
Armor](Carburized_Steel_Plate_Armor "wikilink") and 20lbs lighter than
[Jumara Scale Armor](Jumara_Scale_Armor "wikilink").

The armor itself is tough to get (see mob description) and is,
naturally, very tough to enchant.
