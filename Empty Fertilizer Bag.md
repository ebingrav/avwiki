-   Doesn't always load on the Ohia Lehua Tree, I'm thinking this is
    probably the kind of thing where you have to kill all the trees
    before one spawns with it. Update: Only one of the trees has it.
    There's at least two trees, and when I got the item, it was NOT the
    tree commonly used as the pp. This other tree is south-east of the
    portal point Lehua! tree.
-   The tree is aggressive, as is pretty much everything else, so there
    may be a few mobs attacking you to start with, keep that in mind.
    The vines backstab, which is extremely painful if not lethal, so if
    you see one in the room with the tree, target that first.
