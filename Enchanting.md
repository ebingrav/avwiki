Enchanting is the process of using [Enchant
Weapon](Enchant_Weapon.md "wikilink"), [Enchant
Armor](Enchant_Armor.md "wikilink") and [Enchant
Bow](Enchant_Bow.md "wikilink") to improve an item of that type. While
enchanting gear is not necessary, gear with enchantments are highly
prized, especially hero level gear that is either single or double
[brilled](Brilling.md "wikilink").

Enchanting carries a price, however. One can either successfully enchant
the item, adding either +1 [hr](Hit_Roll.md "wikilink")/+1
[dr](Damage_Roll.md "wikilink") (+2/+2 with a brilled enchant weapon),
-2 [AC](Armor_Class.md "wikilink") (-3 AC with a brilled enchant armor)
or +2 hit roll (+3 with a brilled enchant bow) respectively, the item
can [fade](Fading.md "wikilink"), explode, or nothing at all can happen.
In the case of a successful enchant or a fade, the item will raise in
level, depending on the level of the caster with respect to the item.

Enchanting items that already have enchantments on them appears to be
more difficult, though much is governed by luck. While some items are
easier to enchant than others, gear with armor class modifiers on them
already, such as [tank gear](:Category:_Hero_Tank_Gear.md "wikilink")
tends to be harder to enchant than items without, such as [ mana
gear](:Category:_Hero_Mana_Gear.md "wikilink"). Certain tank items are
much harder to brill than others, eg. carved bone necklaces vs.
gauntlets of silver.

If you worship certain [Gods and
Goddesses](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses.md "wikilink") then the odds of
successfully enchanting will change based on your deity's presence.
Every so often while enchanting you'll see the message "You feel the
presence of <godname>!". Depending on who you
[worship](worship "wikilink") this can be a good thing or a bad thing.

There is also some speculation that the ingame day and month affect
enchanting. It is believed that "Day of Sun" / "Month of Sun" is a
beneficial combination. Anyone who can attest to this or other
combinations please post your results below.

the calendar has no influence on game mechanics.

In fact, the only variable that appears to have a slight influence on
enchanting ability is the int statistic.
