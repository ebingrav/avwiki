*The enigma spell allows the caster to unleash a mental onslaught on the
target's mind, attempting to debuff them with a variety of mental
afflictions. The success of this spell is influenced by a [hive
mind](Hive_Mind "wikilink"). The more debuffs that are successfully
applied, the lower the chance to cast additional ones.*

*Any negative mental affects on a target, such as
[fear](Fear "wikilink") or [ego whip](Ego_Whip "wikilink"), will
increase the damage bonus for mental-based spells.*

*This spell is EXHAUSTED for a short time when cast and is impacted by
the number of debuffs applied on the target.*

Syntax: cast enigma <target>
