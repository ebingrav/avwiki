*This [ent](Ents "wikilink") [paladin](:Category:_Paladins "wikilink")
seems to have seen many seasons come and go, all leaving their subtle
markings upon his barklike skin. Were it not for his snoring, you might
not have even noticed him here and, instead, mistook him for yet another
tree. He seems so serene in his slumber that you feel hesitant to awaken
him. In his sleep, he mumbles a bit and can you make out just enough of
his words to learn that he recently lost someone very close to him to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s darklin.*
