*This [ent](Ents.md "wikilink")
[berserker](:Category:_Berserkers.md "wikilink"), if not the oldest
[ent](Ents.md "wikilink") that you have ever seen, may well be the
oldest-looking one, with her battle-scarred torso, knotty warped limbs,
and scraggly mold-covered branches. She appears to be looking for
someone and not in much of a mood to linger and chat with anyone for
long, but she does pause just long enough to greet you and to introduce
herself to you briefly--briefly for an [ent](Ents.md "wikilink"), at
least. She explains that [Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink") had
asked [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s Entmoot to provide
some [ents](Ents.md "wikilink") to fight alongside him, and that she is
one of three [ents](Ents.md "wikilink") sent here by them in response.
Apparently, she is not native to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") like her peers but
traveled here long ago from beyond
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink"), which she explains is
very far eastward from this region. She mentions having heard rumors
that some of her relatives there are now battling against invading
[giants](Giants.md "wikilink").*
