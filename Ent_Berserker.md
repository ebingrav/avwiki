*This [ent](Ents "wikilink")
[berserker](:Category:_Berserkers "wikilink"), if not the oldest
[ent](Ents "wikilink") that you have ever seen, may well be the
oldest-looking one, with her battle-scarred torso, knotty warped limbs,
and scraggly mold-covered branches. She appears to be looking for
someone and not in much of a mood to linger and chat with anyone for
long, but she does pause just long enough to greet you and to introduce
herself to you briefly--briefly for an [ent](Ents "wikilink"), at least.
She explains that [Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink") had asked
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s Entmoot to provide some
[ents](Ents "wikilink") to fight alongside him, and that she is one of
three [ents](Ents "wikilink") sent here by them in response. Apparently,
she is not native to [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") like her
peers but traveled here long ago from beyond
[Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood "wikilink"), which she explains is very
far eastward from this region. She mentions having heard rumors that
some of her relatives there are now battling against invading
[giants](Giants "wikilink").*
