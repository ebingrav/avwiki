*This [ent](Ents.md "wikilink")
[paladin](:Category:_Paladins.md "wikilink") seems to have seen many
seasons come and go, all leaving their subtle markings upon his barklike
skin. Were it not for his snoring, you might not have even noticed him
here and, instead, mistook him for yet another tree. He seems so serene
in his slumber that you feel hesitant to awaken him. In his sleep, he
mumbles a bit and can you make out just enough of his words to learn
that he recently lost someone very close to him to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s darklin.*
