*This [ent](Ents.md "wikilink")
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers.md "wikilink") smiles gently at you and very
slowly introduces herself as one of three [ents](Ents.md "wikilink")
sent here by [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s Entmoot to
assist [Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink"), in response to his
petition for their aid. This [ent](Ents.md "wikilink") seems to be
astounded that her Entmoot took only two days to arrive at this
decision, which she worries may have been made far too hastily;
nevertheless, she respects their judgment and seems eager to fight
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s growing darklin
infestation. She seems deeply concerned by how the darklin's activities
have been damaging many of
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s trees, some of which
have even begun to die, and she yearns to help to restore her forest to
health once these darklin have been vanquished and she can once again
wander about it freely without fear of being attacked. She asks you if
you also smell a faint foul odor in the air here; she seems to be rather
perplexed by it.*
