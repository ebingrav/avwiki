*This [ent](Ents "wikilink") [ranger](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink")
smiles gently at you and very slowly introduces herself as one of three
[ents](Ents "wikilink") sent here by
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s Entmoot to assist
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink"), in response to his petition for
their aid. This [ent](Ents "wikilink") seems to be astounded that her
Entmoot took only two days to arrive at this decision, which she worries
may have been made far too hastily; nevertheless, she respects their
judgment and seems eager to fight
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s growing darklin
infestation. She seems deeply concerned by how the darklin's activities
have been damaging many of [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s
trees, some of which have even begun to die, and she yearns to help to
restore her forest to health once these darklin have been vanquished and
she can once again wander about it freely without fear of being
attacked. She asks you if you also smell a faint foul odor in the air
here; she seems to be rather perplexed by it.*
