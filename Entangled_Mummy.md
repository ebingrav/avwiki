*A tangle of roots suspends this foul creature in the middle of the tree
cave. While the roots grow around and into the mummy's body, threads of
undead muscle and sinew grow along the roots and into the giant tree.
Exactly which entity is invading the other can't be told, but the mummy
is undoubtedly the cause of the undead activity in the Walking Woods. As
you draw closer, the mummy's eyes open and it begins to stir in its root
coffin!*
