*Here stands the demigod Erashnak. Through years of dedicated service
Erashnak has gained the favour of her god. From her physical presence
you can see why she has been so successful. She stands head and
shoulders above her brethren. Her hair is platted and trails down her
back to her knees. Upon her body she wears a breastplate of hardened
iron; a gift from her god. On her wrists she wears a pair of jewel
encrusted arm guards which sparkle in the pale light of this realm. Upon
her legs you see a pair of expertly fashioned leggings. They bear
artistic impressions of her exploits in Eragora. Finally, your attention
is drawn to a massive mace which she holds in both hands. Prodruding
from each end are a series of large spikes. Just one clean hit would be
enough to impale you!*
