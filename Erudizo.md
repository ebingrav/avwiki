(White Aura) A drow has made himself at home in Bandu's study.

Erudizo has devoted himself to studying everything there is to know
about everything.

Directions: From [Woe](Woe_The_Sly "wikilink"), n4wn

    Erudizo looks up from his book.
    Erudizo says 'You should look at this book, KNOWN BOONS.'
    Erudizo says 'If you want to know more just say I LIKE BOONS.'
    Erudizo goes back to reading his book.

## Page 1: Known Boons

### Engraving the flesh

A sigil can be carved into the flesh at just the right physical juncture
where the spirit, flesh and magica combine to hinder or harm a subject.
Only one such sigil will work at a time until it heals over. The scars
left over have no effect and do not inhibit a new engraving. Whether you
get the engraving just before midnight or hours before, as soon as the
clock strikes it counts as your first day with the engraving.

(only one active insignia on subject at a time)

### Boosting the spirit

Using a similar concept as the one refined by selfless priests with
martyr, a willing sacrifice can fuel a global effect benefitting all.
The caster channeling the subject's sacrificial magic will be unable to
perform other work while engaged in the ritual.

(Subject loses a stat point to initiate a global boon, no other boons of
any type can be started while this boon is in effect)
