*You can etch [items](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") at certain
places like the [Jeweller](Jeweller.md "wikilink") in
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink") for a price. This gives
the [item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") one additional keyword. It
is a one etch deal, however, and cannot be un-etched. You can only etch
words with 4-12 characters. It is also not possible to etch
[scrolls](:Category:_Scrolls.md "wikilink"), corpses, and certain other
types of [objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink"). We're offering a
potentially powerful tool to you. Treat it wisely. WARNING#1: Color
keywords work... but not in a good way. We suggest not wasting your
money on color unless you want to type your keywords in color.
WARNING#2: The [Immortal Staff](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink") can
see what you add as a keyword. Abuse of current language and in-theme
[policies](:Category:_Policies.md "wikilink") will be enforced and can
result in repercussions if ignored. (If there's too much abuse, the
command will no longer be offered to everyone.)*

Syntax: etch \<[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")\> <keyword>.
