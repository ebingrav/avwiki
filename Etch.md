*You can etch [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") at certain places
like the [Jeweller](Jeweller "wikilink") in
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") for a price. This gives the
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") one additional keyword. It is a
one etch deal, however, and cannot be un-etched. You can only etch words
with 4-12 characters. It is also not possible to etch
[scrolls](:Category:_Scrolls "wikilink"), corpses, and certain other
types of [objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"). We're offering a
potentially powerful tool to you. Treat it wisely. WARNING#1: Color
keywords work... but not in a good way. We suggest not wasting your
money on color unless you want to type your keywords in color.
WARNING#2: The [Immortal Staff](:Category:_Immortals "wikilink") can see
what you add as a keyword. Abuse of current language and in-theme
[policies](:Category:_Policies "wikilink") will be enforced and can
result in repercussions if ignored. (If there's too much abuse, the
command will no longer be offered to everyone.)*

Syntax: etch \<[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")\> <keyword>.
