''Ether is the magical property that connects a spell to its targets.
Ancient scholars delved into its secrets to discover ways to manipulate
this primal force to their advantage. All three Ether spells are
mutually exclusive; you can only be affected by one at a time, and all
three are exhausted upon casting any of them. Unlike chaos channel, the
Ether spells work the same regardless of spell level, combat, surge,
quicken, or other factors. These spells are lost to history, and cannot
be learned from any teacher.

''Ether Link makes it easier to channel spells to multiple targets. For
every target of an area attack spell beyond the first, you will receive
a refund of the original spell cost.

''Ether Warp distorts your connection to the Ether, making enemy area
attack spells miss you 50% of the time. Your own area attack spells will
miss 20% of their targets as well.

''While affected with Ether Crash, your next area attack spell costs
only half mana to cast, but afterwards you cannot use any area attack
spell for a short time.

Wizards can gain Ether Crash by reading the [
spellbook](:Category:Spellbooks "wikilink") [Rediscovering Ether, Book 3
In A 3 Part
Series](Rediscovering_Ether,_Book_3_In_A_3_Part_Series "wikilink").

Each ether spell is a self only spell that has a duration of around 12
ticks. When it is cast it exhausts [Ether Link](Ether_Link "wikilink"),
[Ether Crash](Ether_Crash "wikilink") and [Ether
Warp](Ether_Warp "wikilink") for 3 or 4 ticks.
