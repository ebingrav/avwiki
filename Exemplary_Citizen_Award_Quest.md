Find the caretaker in orphanage. He will ask you to find and tickle
rascally orphans. When you find one (use *where rascally*) and they give
you their item, take it to the caretaker for the next instructions;
don't bother tickling the rascally orphans after you have an item to
give to the Caretaker or else they just run around in circles.

Once you return both cleaning supplies, he will ask you to go to the
marketplace and bring back pie crust and frozen pumpkin.

Once you submit those, you will receive [Exemplary Citizen Award
Insignia](Exemplary_Citizen_Award_Insignia "wikilink"), together with a
free level, so be sure to have high TNL.
