*A [paladin](:Category:_Paladins "wikilink") will call upon their God to
purge demons which have affected their body. Their God often will
respond by purging these demons, and afford a small healing bonus to the
[paladin](:Category:_Paladins "wikilink"). To gain enough of their God's
favour for this, the paladin must have an aura of
[sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") (the [sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink")
must be provided from a [cast](Cast "wikilink")
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink")) at the time of the prayer. They
lose this aura during the process of [casting](Cast "wikilink") the
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"), [Turn
Demon](Turn_Demon "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'exorcism'.

If you attempt to cast this without sanc, it will take the casting cost
but your god will refuse to do it.  
For a lizard, it healed 70 hp, cost 38 mana, and lags for 5 seconds (and
removes sanc).

This will clear demonfire. It can be cast as long as "oath evolution" is
not active.
