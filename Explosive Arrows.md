*Hero archers who have attained a sufficient level of power may learn
how to fletch highly deadly explosive arrows. The art of fletching such
projectiles is particularly intricate and time-consuming; it also tends
to incur great exhaustion. Because of this fatigue, Archers may find it
difficult to fletch many explosive projectiles in quick succession.*

Hero archers and fusiliers can learn this skill at sub-lvl 250. There's
currently no help file for Explosive Stones but they work the same as
the arrows except in slings instead of bows. The exhaustion is one hour
of logged on time (although it does not list in the [affects
command](Affects "wikilink") and you are not notified when it is
exhausted). It is also important to have *config -savespell* when
getting rid of this invisible exhaust.
