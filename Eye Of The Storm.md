*With clouds raging all around in utter madness this space seems like a
refuge, yet in fact it is nothing but the location of the cause of this
swirl. A presence surrounds you, causing your mind to hallucinate,
evoking images of old forests and storm-beaten mountain tops, of
lightning piercing an old trunk, of leaves torn along by the wind - it
will only be so long until this mental pressure will break the dams of
your sanity.*
