Fading is the process of using the spells [enchant
weapon](Enchant_Weapon "wikilink"), [enchant
armor](Enchant_Armor "wikilink") or [enchant
bow](Enchant_Bow "wikilink") with the hopes of receiving the message
"<item> grows brightly, then fades." Fading removes all current
enchantments on the item, as well as any
[flags](:Category:_Object_Flags "wikilink"). Flags such as
[Anti-Good](Anti-Good_Flag "wikilink"), [Magic](Magic_Flag "wikilink"),
[NoDrop](NoDrop_Flag "wikilink") and
[NoRemove](NoRemove_Flag "wikilink") are the primary flags people
attempt to remove by fading, though the latter two are more commonly
removed by using [remove curse](Remove_Curse "wikilink").

Since many [Hero](:Category:_Hero "wikilink") level gear is
[Anti-Good](Anti-Good_Flag "wikilink") by default, fading is a practical
requirement for use (except for
[Shadowfist](:Category:_Shadowfists "wikilink") and
[Sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers "wikilink") characters who have
practiced [Demonic Intent](Demonic_Intent "wikilink"), who in turn would
need items that load [Anti-Evil](Anti-Evil_Flag "wikilink") to be faded
prior to their use.

Items with the [magic flag](Magic_Flag "wikilink") need to be faded
prior to being [transmuted](Transmute "wikilink"). This most commonly
happens when one wants to dual-wield the same weapon, but lacks the
rogue skills [balance](Balance "wikilink") and
[poise](Poise "wikilink"). With the magic flag removed, an item can be
transmuted lighter or heavier to be used in the offhand or main wield
slot, respectively. Remember that transmuting an item will raise its
level by 1 or 2 levels.

Since fading is a random result of the enchant spells, very often an
item can be rendered unusable in the process of trying to fade it. For
instance, an item that loads [Anti-Good](Anti-Good_Flag "wikilink") can
receive the [Anti-Evil flag](Anti-Evil_Flag "wikilink") and the
[Anti-Neutral flag](Anti-Neutral_Flag "wikilink") when a good aligned
caster "successfully" enchants the weapon. Since both successfully
enchanting and fading add a level to the item, an item which still
hasn't faded at level 54 (for [hero
armor](:Category:_Hero_Gear "wikilink")) or level 56 (for [hero
weapons](:Category:_Hero_Gear "wikilink")) must either be
[harmed](Harmonizing "wikilink") or scrapped.
