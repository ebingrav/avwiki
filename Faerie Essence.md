The Unravelling maze has random exits, but the maze isn't too deep (4-5
rooms?) before you reach the Unmaker. Both the east and west exits from
Mother Weaver lead to the first room of the maze. After that you can't
go back to her room, so make sure your group is well regenned before
leaving the safe room. In each subsequent room there's only one correct
direction to proceed.

Turn by Turn Directions

Crew required: 1 tank and lots of bang

A large group of at least 15 is required to get to Unmaker. After that
