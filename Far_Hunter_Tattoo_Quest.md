-   After arriving to the [Rim](:Category:Rim.md "wikilink"), go wild.
-   Eventually you will have attracted the attention of one or more sea
    deities that dwell there.
-   Kill them all.

<spoiler> You can see what sea deity you're attracting by the color of
the special death messages:

-   Lumoloth - no messages,
-   Crattenos - red blood message,
-   Muo Wishene - blue floating corpses messages,
-   Mnephrikos - black messages that sink below the surface.

Once you achieve enough kills for a specific sea deity, a special
message will appear and the sea deity will start hunting you. Be
prepared - both to kill it and to skin it as some of them yield good
items.

Leaving the area will reset your progress to zero and you will have to
start your murdering spree afresh. So, don't leave until done, be
prepared to respell self and group, and grab the utensil aforehand so
you can finish the quest immediately.</spoiler>

-   [Far Hunter](Far_Hunter "wikilink") will want to tattoo your
    achievements onto your skin so find an appropriate utensil.

<spoiler>This is a tricky one as it requires a skinner to be present.
Break through the Fog and into the Pocket of Calm Water. There you
should be able to locate a squid. Skin it for Quill and Ink, and then go
back to the Hunter. Give him the item. He will return it to you
immediately so you can use it again on another party member.</spoiler>

-   Gain the [Far Hunter Tattoo
    Insignia](Far_Hunter_Tattoo_Insignia "wikilink").
