*Fetch is a [telekinetic
spell](:Category:_Telekinetic_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") that
forms a magical lasso which can carry small, inanimate
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") to the caster, sometimes
from several [rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") away. However, you
can only fetch [items](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") that are within
the same [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"), and under a certain
[weight](Object_Weight.md "wikilink"). There are also certain magical
properties of [room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") and
[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") that may help, hinder or
outright prevent a fetch attempt. Be as specific as possible with the
argument of this [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink"). Use full
words instead of abbreviations, and use more than one keyword for the
[item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") if possible. This will help to
avoid mix-ups.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'fetch'
