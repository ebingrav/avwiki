I think part of this is wrong. se of Seneca is a room titled "One way
down" and has an exit down. Down there is parts not on the map (like
Ruddloaf Mortlock). --[Ylem](User:Ylem "wikilink") 14:26, 25 May 2011

This is intentional. I left certain elements off the map, so let people
explore for a while. What's the point of a guardroom with sings
"DANGER!", if there's nothing behind the guardroom that the guards
protect, no? :) Similar for other parts of the map.
