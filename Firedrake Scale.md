more than serviceable shield.*

## Comments

This is just as difficult to enchant as [other hero
shields](Shield_Of_Heroes "wikilink"). While 5 off from the top-tier
hero shields this also has a high save vs fire.

This shield already has fire-ward on it, which gives you one more
enchant possibility over [the usual
choice](Shield_Of_Heroes "wikilink"). Since this pops in a xp area,
collecting can be done without much commitment.

This item drops from the [Adult Firedrake](Adult_Firedrake "wikilink").
Like other gear mobs in Deepways it is spawned when another mob is
killed. To spawn this the [Young Firedrake](Young_Firedrake "wikilink")
must be killed first which spawns the [Adolescent
Firedrake](Adolescent_Firedrake "wikilink"). Killing that mob spawns the
adult.

## Directions

The mob wanders in the area and is not portable.
