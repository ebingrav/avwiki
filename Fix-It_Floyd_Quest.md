*The place that produces mobs all around Avatar has been refurbished
recently. After a catastrophic incident with a disobedient Collosus,
Fix-it Floyd took the opportunity to slightly Revise the factory, though
for an old-timer such as him that probably meant something as simple as
finally installing doors.*

*See if you can help Floyd to get the production back on schedule. This
quest is for players up to and including level 11. If some players
cannot access this quest, the problem is psychological, not mechanical.*

This quest rewards the player with the [Do Avatars Dream Of Magical
Sheep?
Insignia](Do_Avatars_Dream_Of_Magical_Sheep?_Insignia "wikilink").

Be sure and pay attention to what Floyd says. Also there are a lot of
things to look at in his room that provide information. For example,
he's afraid of dragons so if you are a dragon (or are wearing an item
that reminds him of one) you might have trouble. Also, note that there
are no 'tentacles' in the mob factory, in his dialogue Floyd says to
replace them with a different piece of mob anatomy.

To complete you'll need 3 heads, 2 torsos, 5 legs, and 4 tails.
