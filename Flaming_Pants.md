Bases: 10-12  
Levels: 50-52  
Weight: 5  
Area: [Apocalypse](:Category:_Apocalypse.md "wikilink")
([Map](Apocalypse_Map.md "wikilink"))  
Mob: [Blazing Man](Blazing_Man "wikilink")  
Portal points are [Skeletal Guard](Skeletal_Guard "wikilink"),
[Terrified Woman](Terrified_Woman "wikilink") or [Shivering
Soldier](Shivering_Soldier "wikilink"). Find and kill all Blazing Men.
Either teleport to them, or locate them with
'[where](Where.md "wikilink") blazing'. There's mobs in other areas with
the keywords blazing man, so watch out with too much teleporting.  
This piece only pops once ALL the blazing men have been killed and then
repop. If it's not out there, kill all the remaining blazing men and
wait for a repop. The Blazing Man that's popped first will be holding
it. So if you teleport to Blazing Man, it will take you to the one with
the pants, and he's also the one who shows up when you type 'where
blazing'. AFAIK, this one pops at the centre of the burning village, u e
4n from the [Shivering Soldier](Shivering_Soldier "wikilink").
