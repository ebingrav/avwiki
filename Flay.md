Prerequisites: [shred](shred "wikilink") </br>Syntax: flay

Your next round of claw attacks will have a chance to flay the
opponent's hide, inflicting painful injuries that hamper their ability
to defend. Flay can only be used when shred is active.

The small of fresh blood off such a grizzley injury focuses the Ripper's
feral instincts. The [Hound](Hound "wikilink"), [Juke](Juke "wikilink")
and [Rend](Rend "wikilink") skills activate more frequently against an
enemy who has been flayed.

This and other High Energy Skills cost HP to execute.
