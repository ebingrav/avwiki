*This strange little man barely seems of [elven](Elves.md "wikilink")
size as he floats above the floor. Dressed in robes with short white
hair and a small moustache, he has a mischievous twinkle in his eye that
warns you not to trust him. He waits to test anyone willing but be
warned, his tests are difficult and sometimes even fatal. Only the
strongest can hope to prevail in [his Hall of
Justice](:Category:_Hall_Of_Justice.md "wikilink") and survive the tests
inside it. It is said that there is [a
treasure](Medallion_Of_Justice.md "wikilink") at the far end of [the
Hall](:Category:_Hall_Of_Justice.md "wikilink") waiting for those strong
enough to claim it. To gain admission he asks only that you return [what
was stolen from him](Scales_Of_Justice.md "wikilink") so that he might
tip the balance even farther into his favor.*
