*This strange little man barely seems of [elven](Elves "wikilink") size
as he floats above the floor. Dressed in robes with short white hair and
a small moustache, he has a mischievous twinkle in his eye that warns
you not to trust him. He waits to test anyone willing but be warned, his
tests are difficult and sometimes even fatal. Only the strongest can
hope to prevail in [his Hall of
Justice](:Category:_Hall_Of_Justice "wikilink") and survive the tests
inside it. It is said that there is [a
treasure](Medallion_Of_Justice "wikilink") at the far end of [the
Hall](:Category:_Hall_Of_Justice "wikilink") waiting for those strong
enough to claim it. To gain admission he asks only that you return [what
was stolen from him](Scales_Of_Justice "wikilink") so that he might tip
the balance even farther into his favor.*
