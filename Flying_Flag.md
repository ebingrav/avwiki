Flying [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") or
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") may hover above
[water](Water_Terrain.md "wikilink"), go up in certain places, access
certain rooms, [use less moves](Movement_Costs.md "wikilink"), and more.

There are many ways to fly.
[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") of some
[races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") possess [an innate ability to
fly](Racial_Fly.md "wikilink") for certain lengths of time.
[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") of some
[classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") may
[learn](Practice.md "wikilink") to [levitate](Levitation.md "wikilink"),
to [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") [Fly](Fly.md "wikilink") on both
themselves and others, or both. Even
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") without such
[skills](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") may consume
[certain objects](:Category:_Spellcasting_Gear.md "wikilink") like
[potions](:Category:_Potions.md "wikilink") to make themselves fly
temporarily. And some [gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") (like
[griffon wings bracers](Griffon_Wings_Bracer.md "wikilink")) may cause
either [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") or
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") that [wear](Wear.md "wikilink") it
to fly until they [remove](Remove.md "wikilink") it. Some
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") may also have a
"[flag](:Category:_Mob_Flags.md "wikilink")" that causes them to fly
permanently unless [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink")
[cast](Cast.md "wikilink") a [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink")
like [Earthbind](Earthbind.md "wikilink") on them.
