Flying [characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") or
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") may hover above
[water](Water_Terrain "wikilink"), go up in certain places, access
certain rooms, [use less moves](Movement_Costs "wikilink"), and more.

There are many ways to fly.
[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") of some
[races](:Category:_Races "wikilink") possess [an innate ability to
fly](Racial_Fly "wikilink") for certain lengths of time.
[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") of some
[classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") may
[learn](Practice "wikilink") to [levitate](Levitation "wikilink"), to
[cast](Cast "wikilink") [Fly](Fly "wikilink") on both themselves and
others, or both. Even [characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink")
without such [skills](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") may
consume [certain objects](:Category:_Spellcasting_Gear "wikilink") like
[potions](:Category:_Potions "wikilink") to make themselves fly
temporarily. And some [gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") (like [griffon
wings bracers](Griffon_Wings_Bracer "wikilink")) may cause either
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") or
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") that [wear](Wear "wikilink") it to
fly until they [remove](Remove "wikilink") it. Some
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") may also have a
"[flag](:Category:_Mob_Flags "wikilink")" that causes them to fly
permanently unless [characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink")
[cast](Cast "wikilink") a [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") like
[Earthbind](Earthbind "wikilink") on them.
