*His magic flows from [Bhyss](Bhyss.md "wikilink"), greatly increasing
the [spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") he flings at his enemies,
though he pays a terrible price: his dreams are racked with visions of
destruction and death that disturb his sleep night after night. He shuns
others, enjoying the reward that comes from each battle, although he
does not physically grow as fast as he used to, before
[Bhyss](Bhyss.md "wikilink"). Yet the true devotees covet the decreased
cost on their bodies when magic is flung outward to dominate their
enemy's every move.*
