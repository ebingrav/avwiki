*From the looks of it, this dog was once as wild and dangerous as the
ones you have seen outside of [the hermit](Hermit.md "wikilink")'s
shelter. But it seems to be domesticated and quite friendly thanks to
the care given by [this strange hermit](Hermit.md "wikilink"). He
wiggles his tail and barks playfully at you. A tag around the neck says
'Foodles'. As Foodles keeps on barking and wiggling you figure out what
he wants! He wants to play with [his ball](Golden_Ball.md "wikilink").
But where is it?*
