*From the looks of it, this dog was once as wild and dangerous as the
ones you have seen outside of [the hermit](Hermit "wikilink")'s shelter.
But it seems to be domesticated and quite friendly thanks to the care
given by [this strange hermit](Hermit "wikilink"). He wiggles his tail
and barks playfully at you. A tag around the neck says 'Foodles'. As
Foodles keeps on barking and wiggling you figure out what he wants! He
wants to play with [his ball](Golden_Ball "wikilink"). But where is it?*
