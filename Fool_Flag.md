*If you have been FOOLed then you have done something to annoy an
[immortal](:Category:_Immortals "wikilink") which, in their eyes is
foolish. While you are a fool you will not regenerate [hit
points](Hit_Points "wikilink"), [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink"), or
[movement points](Move_Points "wikilink"). And while you are foolish any
restores will set all those stats to 0/0/0. It is very annoying to say
the least, but so is being a fool, no?*
