*As you begin to gape in awe at the [dragon](Dragons "wikilink")'s
enormous head, its eyes open. "Hello, adventurer. At long last, someone
has found me. I have lied beneath this prison of earth since the Great
War, and have been relatively solitary until recently. A few days ago,
an evil [drow](Drow "wikilink")
[sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers "wikilink") infiltrated [my
cavern](:Category:_Forgotten_One "wikilink") and discovered me. Being as
evil as he is, he decided to leech off the power of an ancient
[dragon](Dragons "wikilink"). He pried open my jaw and stepped inside. I
have no idea where he resides within me, but I suspect it to be in the
source of all power - the heart. Young hero, I believe you possess the
[skills](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") to help me. It takes a great
amount of power to open my maw, so I can only do it once more before my
power completely fades. To prove your worth to me, I enlist you to fetch
me [a dragon-sized meal](Large_Chunk_Of_Quixophant "wikilink"). If you
can provide me with this, I will open my mouth and allow you to seek and
destroy [the evil sorcerer](Mutate,_Sycoltan "wikilink"). I am sorry I
have to put you through this test, but [the
sorcerer](Mutate,_Sycoltan "wikilink") is draining my power quickly. One
other thing, please inform me of what he is using my power for. Just for
curiosity's sake." The [dragon](Dragons "wikilink")'s nose flares and a
stream of flame shoots out, just missing you!*
