*As you begin to gape in awe at the [dragon](Dragons.md "wikilink")'s
enormous head, its eyes open. "Hello, adventurer. At long last, someone
has found me. I have lied beneath this prison of earth since the Great
War, and have been relatively solitary until recently. A few days ago,
an evil [drow](Drow.md "wikilink")
[sorcerer](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink") infiltrated [my
cavern](:Category:_Forgotten_One.md "wikilink") and discovered me. Being
as evil as he is, he decided to leech off the power of an ancient
[dragon](Dragons.md "wikilink"). He pried open my jaw and stepped
inside. I have no idea where he resides within me, but I suspect it to
be in the source of all power - the heart. Young hero, I believe you
possess the [skills](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") to help me. It
takes a great amount of power to open my maw, so I can only do it once
more before my power completely fades. To prove your worth to me, I
enlist you to fetch me [a dragon-sized
meal](Large_Chunk_Of_Quixophant.md "wikilink"). If you can provide me
with this, I will open my mouth and allow you to seek and destroy [the
evil sorcerer](Mutate,_Sycoltan.md "wikilink"). I am sorry I have to put
you through this test, but [the
sorcerer](Mutate,_Sycoltan.md "wikilink") is draining my power quickly.
One other thing, please inform me of what he is using my power for. Just
for curiosity's sake." The [dragon](Dragons.md "wikilink")'s nose flares
and a stream of flame shoots out, just missing you!*
