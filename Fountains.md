[Objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") of this
[type](:Category:_Object_Types "wikilink") are practically always
permanent fixtures of [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") that
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may not [pick
up](Get "wikilink") (exception: Immortals can bypass the no-take flags
on these and other items, like portals). Fountains were more useful in
days of yore when Avatar's
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") could suffer from hunger
and thirst. Certain fountains remain useful, however, as fountains can
do more than just provide a steady source of one of many
[types](Drink_Container_Values "wikilink") of liquid refreshment. A
given fountain may or may not also do one of the following whenever a
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") [drinks](Drink "wikilink")
from it: (1) [cast](Cast "wikilink") a predictable
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") on this
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") (or possibly one of two
different [spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") dependent upon this
drinker's [alignment](Alignment "wikilink")), (2)
[poison](Poison_(spell) "wikilink") this
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink"), (3) instantly transport
this [character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") to a certain other
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"), and (4) disappear (until its
[area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") repops) while a certain
[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") appears in its place. Each fountain's
individual qualities are determined by its
[type](:Category:_Object_Types "wikilink")-specific
[values](:Category:_Object_Values "wikilink").
