*Flushed and frenzied, this wiry creature moves in sudden jerks, eyes
darting wildly with almost human-like intelligence. Its mouth opens and
shuts in spasms, but not a sound escapes as it shivers in the grip of
some strange fever.*

## Comments

It occurs to you that the behaviour of that poor creature was bizarrely
different to that of its brethren. Collecting some of the [ spilt
ichor](Phial_of_Vile_Ichor.md "wikilink") near the corpse, you resolve
to ask someone who is an expert in liquids to look at it for you.
