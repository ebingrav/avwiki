*A [goblin](Goblins.md "wikilink") crouches in the shadowy passage,
gripping her basket tightly. Looking at you a shimmer of hope flickers
over her face. Stammering slightly she explains that she is from [the
neighbouring cave](:Category:_Mushroom_Caves.md "wikilink"), rich with
mushrooms. She wishes to become [the
shaman](Goblin_Shaman.md "wikilink")'s apprentice and believes that [a
few pieces of special mushroom](Glowing_Mushroom_Piece.md "wikilink")
might convince [the old mixer of potions](Goblin_Shaman.md "wikilink").
And somewhere down deep in these caverns here there are supposed to be
some truly magical ones - but it is so scary!*
