*A [goblin](Goblins "wikilink") crouches in the shadowy passage,
gripping her basket tightly. Looking at you a shimmer of hope flickers
over her face. Stammering slightly she explains that she is from [the
neighbouring cave](:Category:_Mushroom_Caves "wikilink"), rich with
mushrooms. She wishes to become [the shaman](Goblin_Shaman "wikilink")'s
apprentice and believes that [a few pieces of special
mushroom](Glowing_Mushroom_Piece "wikilink") might convince [the old
mixer of potions](Goblin_Shaman "wikilink"). And somewhere down deep in
these caverns here there are supposed to be some truly magical ones -
but it is so scary!*
