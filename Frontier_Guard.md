*This frontier guard looks tired and weary, having been constantly under
the threat of orcish raids for some time now. His armor is a bit
tarnished, as is his morale. Perhaps soon, the politicians back in
Midgaard will agree to send more funds and support to this frontier
outpost. Until then, this guard knows it's going to be a long haul. His
only consolation is that he gets to peg off orcs from up here with his
crossbow, instead of fight them toe to toe down below.*
