*Fury of the Mind allows a [Psi](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") to
participate in the anger of its allies, without becoming enraged
themselves. While attuned to the minds of their companions in this way,
the [Psi](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") can utilize that rage to
increase the damage inflicted when casting a
[kinetic](:Category:_Telekinetic_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") damage
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") like [weapon
rush](Weapon_Rush "wikilink") or [dancing
weapon](Dancing_Weapon "wikilink"). While there is a limit to the anger
that the [Psi](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") can control in this
way, up to that limit the power of the
[Psi](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink")'s attacks will increase in
accordance with the strength of the [frenzies](Frenzy "wikilink")
filling their allies. Fury of the Mind requires the
[Psionicist](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") to keep their emotional
balance. Being in a [frenzied](Frenzy "wikilink") state themselves will
make it impossible to attune to the angers of the allies in the required
way, or even break the link.*

Prerequisite(s): [Anger Management](Anger_Management "wikilink"), [Bio
Empathy](Bio_Empathy "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'fury of the mind'.
