*All [Stormlord](:Category:_Stormlords.md "wikilink")
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") manipulate weather in a very
localized manner. They can call forth a blizzard in the middle of a
summer meadow, or a shower of rain while miles underground. They must be
sustained, and will end early if the caster is struck, moved, or enters
a command. Gale summons a high wind, which deflects [arrows and other
small projectiles](:Category:_Ammunition.md "wikilink").
[Longshotting](Longshot.md "wikilink") into or out of a gale is nearly
impossible, and other ranged attacks within the area will be less
successful. This [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") affects ally
and foe alike, and sometimes lingers briefly after the
[Stormlord](:Category:_Stormlords.md "wikilink") stops controlling it.*

Prerequisite(s): ?.

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'gale'.
