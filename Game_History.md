## 1996

The following is all that we know about pre-1997, however.

-   **June 16th, 1996:**

  
\- Inline color implemented. Everyone has the ability to change the
color

of the various texts they type. Refer to help 'inline color' for the

syntax.

\- Lord Channel added. Only Lords and above may send to or hear from it.

\- Last command changed so that it displays an identifying label instead
of

just physical level (eg. 100th level Mage Hero, vs. Level 51 Mage)

\- Channel +all/-all fixed so that it toggles all channels on/off,
instead

of activating deaf mode.

\- New learning system introduced. Players now have the possiblity of

increasing their adept level higher than the maximum practiced
percentage.

The chances of successfully raising a spell/skill depend on two things:

Percentage practiced up to this point, and whether you incur a
successful

usage of the spell/skill or not.

-   **2nd of June, 1996:**

  
\- Lords have been implemented. After a hero passes herolevel 500, they

may attempt a morph into a Lord. Failure rate drops as the player grows

closer to level 999. Penalties for failure also decrease, as they get

closer to 999.

\- Legends and Titans are created in a similar fashion to Lords, but
instead

of herolevels, a Lord must be Lordlevel 500+ to morph into a Legend, and

a Legend must be Legendlevel 500+ to attempt a morph into a Titan.

\- Planeshift spell added. This spell allows a Lord or above to teleport

into another plane.

\- Fullness and Thirst values changed. Consumption rates vary according

race.

-   **26th of May, 1996:**

  
\- Nosun racial reinstated. Those 'dark' races affected by it will be

unable to regenerate properly, and will have a delay in the usage of

socials.

\- Planes have been put in. Teleport, locate object, and other similar

spells will not work across planes. Existing planes include: Outland,

Immortal Plane, the Arena, the Hero Quest, and Midgaardia. Midgaardia

is the major world.

\- Area flags introduced. These flags act like room flags, except they

affect the entire area. Examples of these flags are no-summon and

no-plague.

\* Meadow is no-summon and no-plague. Players will not be able to summon

a mob or PC of any kind into the Meadow. Also, plague will continue to

hurt anyone affected by it, but will not spread.

-   **5th of May, 1996:**

  
\- New Races, and racial abilities added. Version 6 players may take

advantage of the skills given to their race.

\- Afar code now in. Can now use socials with a person in another room.

Afars can only be done with people in the same area, and will not work

in private rooms.

-   **12th of May, 1996:**

  
\- Angels are in, of course, and with them you can now "who angel"

and note angel.
