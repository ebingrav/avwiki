*An elderly paladin is busy keeping an eye on the Hall.*

  
Ganastrikos is a man well known throughout Midgaard. Tales from his

youth are still sung in taverns and his deeds and accomplishments are

the source of inspiration for many young adventurers. He now spends

his days giving advice to young knights and overseeing the Hall of

Paladins. While somber in appearance there is something of a

mischievous glint to his eyes.

Ganastrikos is in perfect health.
