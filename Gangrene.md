*Sorcerors around the world have long yearned for a way to keep their
corpses safe from ravenous mobs. After years of study, a talented
Sorceror, renowned for their devotion to Bhyss (it is rumoured that
Bhyss shared this knowledge in exchange for eternal damnation of the
Sorceror) developed a formula, which, once imbibed, rendered their dead
bodies so noxious that no foe, no matter how starved, could go within 10
feet of their decaying corpse without being repulsed.*

*The sorceror must not be too healthy, lest their natural immunities
repel the disease, and not too weak, otherwise their body would crumble
and die instantly at first taste of the liquid.*
