The Gargoyle Bracer Quest continues on from the [Nyad Letter
Quest](Nyad_Letter_Quest "wikilink") (level 1-19).

After gaining access to the Nyad's bedroom (at the end of the Nyad
Letter Quest), you may be able to obtain a lock of her hair (which is
invisible), if you are high enough level (level 18) to see it.

-   [Give](Give.md "wikilink") [a lock of long white Nyad
    hair](Lock_Of_Long_White_Nyad_Hair.md "wikilink") to [a drider
    witch](Drider_Witch.md "wikilink") and receive the [gargoyle
    bracer](Gargoyle_Bracer.md "wikilink").

<spoiler text='Spoiler : explicit instructions on how to complete this quest (via theft) are here.'>
To steal the hair (nb. a bit quicker, but this will cause you to get a
bad result from the Nyad Quest):

-   Go to [Baron Amier Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre "wikilink") in
    [Sarphyre's Court](Sarphyre's_Court "wikilink").
-   Go east, east, north, north to a display case in a crumbling
    hallway.
-   Inspect / dismantle the trap on the case (this requires a
    [rogue](rogue "wikilink"), [bci](bci "wikilink"), or
    [:Category:Bladedancers](:Category:Bladedancers "wikilink")
    character of level 22 or above).
-   Pick the lock on the case (this requires a
    [rogue](rogue "wikilink"), [bci](bci "wikilink"), or
    [:Category:Bladedancers](:Category:Bladedancers "wikilink")
    character of level 1 or above).
-   Get the glyph from the display case.
-   Go east, east, east, up, west, south, up, south, down, south, south,
    to the [Nyad](Nyad "wikilink").
-   Give the glyph to the nyad.
-   Enter nexus she creates.
-   Pick up the (invisible) [Lock Of Long White Nyad
    Hair](Lock_Of_Long_White_Nyad_Hair "wikilink").
-   There will also be a [Potion Of Nyad's
    Kiss](Potion_Of_Nyad's_Kiss "wikilink") you can take.
