So what does this spell do?

The short answer is nothing.

The long answer is this was a very old grandfathered spell from stock
MERC, in stock MERC it is mob only and it summons/creates a mob
(typically a demon) that would assist the mob that summoned it in
fighting the player. The Immortals deemed that it was appropriate to
have this spell disabled/removed from the game.

So, the question is, does [Millament's
Staff](Millament's_Staff "wikilink") do anything?

as Explained above nope it does not :/

I'm not sure, but I think that at one point this spell was castable by
player characters. The version of the story I heard was that people
would use it to leave relatively high level aggie mobs hanging out in
newbie areas. Hence why it was removed. [Waite](User:Waite "wikilink")
