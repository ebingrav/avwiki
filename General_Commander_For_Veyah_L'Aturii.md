*A tall humanoid that has been paid handsomely for his service to Veyah,
this general commander has spent most of his time in this altar room
trying to prepare day in and day out for the fight that has never come.
His clothes - a green shirt jacket and pants - have since become two
sizes too big as those who brought him food have either passed on or
forgotten about him.*

## Comments

The mob is big and sanced, but not aggie. It can toss. If you give this
mob [the battle commands for Veyah's
commander](Battle_Commands_For_Veyah's_Commander.md "wikilink"), he will
transport you to [The Hidden Room Of The
Necropolis](The_Hidden_Room_Of_The_Necropolis_(Necropolis).md "wikilink").
