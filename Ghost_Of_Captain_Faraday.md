*Turning to you, the woman looks you over critically for a moment or
two, before nodding to herself as if deciding that you will do.*

*"I am Captain Faraday," she introduces herself. "As you can see... I am
dead. It's common enough around here, though a good many of those who do
not sleep well do not fully comprehend their situation. Why there are so
many unsettled spirits here, I do not know. Perhaps it is simply because
this is a place of the dead, but perhaps there is another reason...
Regardless, I wish to do something to ease my fellow spirits' souls. If
you can bring me proof that you have helped three of the ghosts in this
place, I will reward you.*

*"Now go."*

*With that, she returns to her pacing and pays you no more heed.*
