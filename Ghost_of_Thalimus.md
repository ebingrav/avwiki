*Sensing your gaze upon him, this ghost turns and looks at you in
surprise, his dead eyes searching.*

*"Greetings explorer," he whispers, his voice from beyond the grave. "I
am Thalimus, architect of the Great Wall. You should leave this place
soon... it is not as safe as it appears. It was a mistake to choose this
place as a graveyard. An ancient evil was interred here countless years
before, and now I fear it begins to stir in its slumber. I can feel the
taint infecting the land. But what can be done? Nothing I fear... for I
cannot leave this place. Perhaps someone else..."*

*He seems to lose interest in you again, and stares once more into space
at things no living eyes can see.*
