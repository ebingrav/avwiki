*A ghostly transparent spirit floats through the air. He looks at
everything and misses nothing. At times it seems his gaze is not seeing
his immediate surroundings, but something far off in the distance,
hidden from ordinary view.  
  
He smiles and speaks.  
  
"Perhaps there is something useful left in [the
ruins](:Category:_Ruined_Lairs "wikilink"). The arrogant ones plotted
and built, collected an army and prepared to do battle. But they tried
to use dark magic they did not understand, and it backfired, destroying
them all and all their hidden haunts and servants. Or perhaps destroyed
is not the right way to put it, some of them were instead twisted by the
dark magic, remade into things which move and hate, yet are no longer
alive. I suspect most of what might be recovered from [the
ruins](:Category:_Ruined_Lairs "wikilink") will be just as twisted, but
perhaps not all of it. I know [one of the
lairs](:Category:_Ruined_Lair_1_Of_5 "wikilink") was hidden in
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink") itself to spy on the city
from the inside. Look carefully for clues to the other sites and always
be on your guard, for those that guard them never sleep."*
