*Can you even really consider this to be a real object? You did not
realise that items could even have ghosts. The implications are
enormous. Do objects have souls? Is there an afterlife for them? Could
you reanimate one? Who would be able to even do such a thing? Questions,
questions.*

At a first glance, this is a trash item.

Please note that the saves are *positive*, thus worsening the
resistances.

Not that you should be wearing *this* one anyway.
