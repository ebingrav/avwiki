*Gilliad focuses upon maintaining the solidity of this plane against
attacks by other beings. Unlike a plane, Thorngate is a temporary fluke
of nature. To keep this plane in existence, someone of power must always
be vigilant against its collapsing. Recently, however, there have been
unnatural occurrences. Unlike a fold of this bubble, where Thorngate
tries to collapse upon itself, something or someone is attempting to
pierce this plane and create a rift.*

*Astra, the ruler of this plane, was there that first time and was able
to repel the attack and strengthen the weakened area of the plane.
Within hours, Gilliad arrived through a vortex and offered his services
to maintain the plane. He did not give reasons and only the heritage of
his race satisfied Astra of his sincerity. Ignoring you, his eyes
unfocus as he stares up at nothing.*
