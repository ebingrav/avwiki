*A born soldier, Wiv'githmuri was given his greatest challenge and his
first of his career, to set up a successful base upon this world. Born
as Wiv, he was given the addition of 'muri after killing a daemon that
invaded their domain in Limbo. After that point, it was a matter of time
until Wiv'muri was given the additional title of gith so he could
command.*
