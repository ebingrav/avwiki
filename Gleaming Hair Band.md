appearance of a gorgeous mane - and it will make a normal plait look
scruffy. Those are the dangers of wearing things too beautiful. A single
golden hair speaks of the former though.*

Pp [Experienced Archer](Experienced_Archer "wikilink"). She is in a four
room area where only one of the rooms is not cursed. She, wyrms of air,
a distortion (warning: mimic), and rough-skinned worms wander in that
same area. If you are in the area and type 'where air' or 'where rough'
or 'where experienced' and the room is 'Slithering over an ice-covered
trunk' then you can teleport to that mob. Make sure you use all key
words or 2. for multiple worms. Otherwise you will need go through the
tree to get to that area.
