*The clerics of Werredan inspire acts of valour in those around them.
Their secrets are now available to all clerics. This spell will increase
the experience gains of characters allied to a cleric casting this spell
when foes significantly stronger than the group are defeated.*

*Individual clerics will have different spell strengths influenced by
how closely aspects of their deities correspond with those of Werredan.*

*This is a powerful pantheon spell. Any single cleric can only maintain
(i.e. be the caster of) one of these spells at any given time.*

Syntax: cast 'glorious conquest'

## Comments

This spell has a base duration of 8 ticks at Hero (and Lord?).

The exact effect of the spell differs from cleric to cleric, largely
depending on which god the caster [worships](Worship "wikilink"), but
also apparently to an extent depending on the caster's race. The power
of the spell is the same for both Heroes and Lords. This spell only
works on mobs above a certain level.

This spell generally has less of an affect at lord as the minimum mob
level required is relatively higher.
