## Comments

There are two of this item, one with modifies hit roll -10 and a useful
one which modifies damage roll +10. Nice item for low heroes before they
can make a decent [Shard Of Black Doom
Marble](Shard_Of_Black_Doom_Marble "wikilink") or [Orb Of Amorphous
Essence](Orb_Of_Amorphous_Essence "wikilink").

[Teleport](Teleport "wikilink") [Stone

Lair of Shyu'Yao area.

From here go e,s,u to enter a maze. To get through the maze go n, u, e,
n, e and get [key](a_Key_to_the_Root_of_Evil "wikilink") from ground.
The knight in this room carries the version with -10 hit roll.

Go w, d, w - takes you back to the room before maze. Unlock d and go 2d,
s unlock e and go east and kill the lich. Loot corpse for keys
([claw](The_claw_of_Shyu%27Yao "wikilink") and [red

item](Contaminated_Flesh "wikilink").

Go w, n, 2u, 2e and unlock and open e and e. Unlock heart and get key

There are probably some aggie mobs along the route,
[sneak](Sneak "wikilink")/[move hidden](Move_Hidden "wikilink") seems to
make them leave you alone except for lich which you have to kill
anyways. Also if there are ghosts in the room with the Chi they can
assist.
