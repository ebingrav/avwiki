## Comments

There are two of this item, one with modifies hit roll -10 and a useful
one which modifies damage roll +10. Nice item for low heroes before they
can make a decent [Shard Of Black Doom
Marble](Shard_Of_Black_Doom_Marble "wikilink") or [Orb Of Amorphous
Essence](Orb_Of_Amorphous_Essence "wikilink").

## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"):** [Lair Of
Shyu'Yao](:Category:_Lair_Of_Shyu'Yao.md "wikilink")
([Map](Lair_Of_Shyu'Yao_Map.md "wikilink")).  
**[Mob(s)](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"):** [the Chi of Zhang
Kai](Chi_Of_Zhang_Kai.md "wikilink").  
[Teleport](Teleport "wikilink") [Stone
Gargoyle](Stone_Gargoyle "wikilink") and go 2s, 2w, u, e to get to the
Lair of Shyu'Yao area.

From here go e,s,u to enter a maze. To get through the maze go n, u, e,
n, e and get [key](a_Key_to_the_Root_of_Evil.md "wikilink") from ground.
The knight in this room carries the version with -10 hit roll.

Go w, d, w - takes you back to the room before maze. Unlock d and go 2d,
s unlock e and go east and kill the lich. Loot corpse for keys
([claw](The_claw_of_Shyu%27Yao.md "wikilink") and [red
key](A_blood_red_key.md "wikilink")) and a [poison
item](Contaminated_Flesh.md "wikilink").

Go w, n, 2u, 2e and unlock and open e and e. Unlock heart and get key
heart unlock down.

Go down and kill The Chi of Zhang Kai for Glyph.

There are probably some aggie mobs along the route,
[sneak](Sneak.md "wikilink")/[move hidden](Move_Hidden.md "wikilink")
seems to make them leave you alone except for lich which you have to
kill anyways. Also if there are ghosts in the room with the Chi they can
assist.
