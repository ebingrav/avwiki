## Comments

To use one of these in the offhand and one as a wield, you need to fade
one and transmute it lighter/heavy Or have poise practiced.

The four different items have their own damage types and resistances:

#### Gnarled Branch of Age

*Crumbled bark covers the branch, gnarled into thick knots resembling
the old faces of the ones that were young when this seed first broke the
ground - and have long turned to dust, so long. But the branch is rich
with the power of life, tiny leaves about to break free and start a new
chapter in the ever-repeating book of life.*

`Modifies melee attacks with earth damage continuous`  
`Faintly lowers resistance to fire continuous`

#### Swirl of Fumes

*Heavy fragrances fill the air, drunkenness of smells. The sweet odour
of blooms circles slowly, dreams of soft surrender and rebirth in an
upcoming spring.*

`Modifies melee attacks with caustic damage continuous`  
`Fainly lowers resistance to air continuous`

#### Grey Orb of Stone

*Radiating with the power of massiveness, of slowed down time, this grey
orb of stone sits on the ground, ragged like a mountain range in
miniature, an assembly of crags and tors, of canyons and glaciers. So
much resistance in a fist of stone.*

`Modifies melee attacks with earth damage continuous`

#### Crackling Sphere of Lightning

*The flicker of lightning bursts from the sphere of ... - There is
nothing except lightning, concentrated into a dense sphere. It rages
with immense power, ready to burn and destroy everything in a glorious
flash.*

`Modifies melee attacks with electric damage continuous`

## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"):** [Transfigured
Forest](:Category:_Transfigured_Forest.md "wikilink")
([Map](Transfigured_Forest_Map.md "wikilink"))  
**[Mob(s)](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"):** [a swirl of fragrant
fumes](Swirl_Of_Fragrant_Fumes.md "wikilink"), [an avalanche of
stones](Avalance_Of_Stones.md "wikilink"), [a storm of
lightning](Storm_Of_Lightning.md "wikilink"), [heavy knotted
branches](Heavy_Knotted_Branches.md "wikilink")  
Mobs are aggresive, so your best bet is to speedwalk. Most mobs can not
see invis however, so that should help a bit.

Portal to [stone trickster](Stone_Trickster.md "wikilink"). e2s, pull
bloom, 2sesese3sdesuwn. You are now in a room with a [heavily scarred
ent](Heavily_Scarred_Ent.md "wikilink").

You can also get to the [ent](Heavily_Scarred_Ent.md "wikilink") by
going e2s, pull bloom, 2sws, enter hole, open south, 3sus. After you
enter the hole, you are in a short,
[private](Private_Rooms.md "wikilink") passage with [2 wandering
mobs](Black_Thin_Tentacle.md "wikilink"). A lot easier then going by the
dissolvers, the wyrms, and the reanimator.

This is a safe room, so regen here if needed. Go u2s. From this point
on, the rooms are [private](Private_Rooms.md "wikilink"),
[noquit](No-Quit_Rooms.md "wikilink"), and you will [not
regen](No-Regen_Rooms.md "wikilink").

Go down. From here, there are four directions to choose, all of which
contain the gear you are looking for - the only difference is in their
names. The direction you want to go will depend on your alignment and
class. This can be done by Lord level players.

-   **North** - No melee for good aligned players (**Angelic
    casters**) - The Swirl of Fumes
-   **East** - No magic for evil aligned players (**Demonic brutes**) -
    The Grey Orb of Stone
-   **West** - No melee for evil aligned players (**Demonic casters**) -
    The Crackling Sphere of Lightning
-   **South** - No magic for good aligned players (**Angelic brutes**) -
    The Gnarled Branch of Age

[The first mob](Cloud_Of_Sweet_Odours.md "wikilink") holds [the
key](Sweet-smelling_Vapour.md "wikilink"). Unlock the next door to get
to [the gear mob](Swirl_Of_Fragrant_Fumes.md "wikilink").

Note that the room with the gear mob doesn't have an exit back to the
room with the key mob, so if you for good spell item go through north
door to gearmob from the mob with key, you can not go back south to the
key mob. It has exits in all four directions and end out in the
transfigured forest.

If you die in one of these rooms, your corpse will be moved out into
*the forest*.
