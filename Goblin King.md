*Sat atop an unstable wooden throne that can barely hold his weight is
the king of this tribes goblins. He has a chunk of meat in one hand, and
a large metal cup in the other, drinking and chewing in turn. He only
stops eating and drinking to bellow an order to his poor servant. Once
he was the terror of nearby settlements leading his goblins on raids.
However since one of the goblins discovered how to make mushroom brew he
has grown lazy, fat and drunk. His axe still sits by his side however,
and it looks sharp.*
