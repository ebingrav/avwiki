*Floating just above the falls, a seedy-looking goblin eyes you as you
approach. "Well met," the goblin spits and hisses. "I wonder if I could
entice you to perform a service for me; the reward is great, you can be
certain."*

*Pausing for a moment to allow you to consider his offer, the odd
creature seems both confident and wary. "Yes, I am an outcast. The City
has never welcomed my kind and I have no regrets. However, I do wish I
had managed to get that scroll."*

*With an evil grin, the magician looks at you and requests in his
gentlest voice, "A cleric has located a tome of particular import. If
you retrieve this manual, I shall reward you handsomely."*
