*This is the goblins shaman. Dressed in animal skins, she has strange
symbols painted all over her body. She has small bones attached around
her body, and a silvery chain around her neck. She drops an ingredient
into the cauldron, resulting in a Bang! followed by a puff of green
smoke. She seems to have taken on the role of alchemist, mixing together
various ingredients with the brew distilled elsewhere. Her blackened,
burned skin suggests her experiments are often unsuccessful.*
