This is the weapon type for [ Paladin
weapons](Paladin_Weapon "wikilink"). They are similar to [ a standard
two-handed weapon](:Category:Standard_Two-Handed_Weapons "wikilink"),
however they can be used with [riposte](riposte "wikilink"). Another
difference is that Godforged weapons cannot be modified via
[Christen](Christen "wikilink") or [Enchant
Weapon](Enchant_Weapon "wikilink") ("This powerful weapon cannot be
modified by conventional means!").
