This field shows how many gold coins a
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") has stored in a
[bank](:Category:_Banks "wikilink");
[gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones "wikilink") are automatically converted
into gold coins when [deposited](Deposit "wikilink") and from gold coins
when [withdrawn](Withdraw_(command) "wikilink").

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may either
[deposit](Deposit "wikilink") or
[withdraw](Withdraw_(command) "wikilink") money, either as [gold in
hand](Gold_In_Hand "wikilink") or as
[gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones "wikilink"), at any
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") that is
[flagged](:Category:_Room_Types "wikilink") as a
[bank](:Category:_Banks "wikilink"); banking may also be done remotely
for a fee via [demonbank](Demonbank "wikilink").

Unlike [gold in hand](Gold_In_Hand "wikilink"), gold stored in a
[bank](:Category:_Banks "wikilink") can not be pilfered by [thieving
mobs](Thieving_Mobs "wikilink") and will not add weight to a
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink")'s
[inventory](Inventory "wikilink"); however, it is not as readily
available as [gold in hand](Gold_In_Hand "wikilink") while
[buying](Buy "wikilink") things.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may view their gold in
bank using their [score](Score "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink").

Weight](Gold_Weight "wikilink").
