This field shows how many gold coins a
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") has stored in a
[bank](:Category:_Banks.md "wikilink");
[gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones.md "wikilink") are automatically
converted into gold coins when [deposited](Deposit.md "wikilink") and
from gold coins when [withdrawn](Withdraw_(command).md "wikilink").

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may either
[deposit](Deposit.md "wikilink") or
[withdraw](Withdraw_(command).md "wikilink") money, either as [gold in
hand](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink") or as
[gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones.md "wikilink"), at any
[room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") that is
[flagged](:Category:_Room_Types.md "wikilink") as a
[bank](:Category:_Banks.md "wikilink"); banking may also be done
remotely for a fee via [demonbank](Demonbank.md "wikilink").

Unlike [gold in hand](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink"), gold stored in a
[bank](:Category:_Banks.md "wikilink") can not be pilfered by [thieving
mobs](Thieving_Mobs.md "wikilink") and will not add weight to a
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink")'s
[inventory](Inventory.md "wikilink"); however, it is not as readily
available as [gold in hand](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink") while
[buying](Buy.md "wikilink") things.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may view their gold in
bank using their [score](Score.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink").

Weight](Gold_Weight.md "wikilink").
