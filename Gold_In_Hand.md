This field shows how many gold coins a
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") is carrying; it ignores
[gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones.md "wikilink"), which also have
monetary value.

It increases as [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") (1)
[loot](Looting.md "wikilink") gold coins from
[mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") corpses or
[lockboxes](Small_Wooden_Lockbox.md "wikilink") that contain them, (2)
[steal](Steal.md "wikilink") gold coins from
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") that carry them, (3) receive gold
coins from other [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"), (4)
[get](Get.md "wikilink")
[money](:Category:_Money.md "wikilink")-[type](:Category:_Object_Types.md "wikilink")
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink"), or (5)
[withdraw](Withdraw_(command).md "wikilink") gold coins at a
[bank](:Category:_Banks.md "wikilink").

It decreases as [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") (1)
[buy](Buy.md "wikilink") goods or services, (2) are pickpocketed by
[thieving mobs](Thieving_Mobs.md "wikilink"), (3)
[give](Give.md "wikilink") gold coins to other
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"), (4)
[drop](Drop.md "wikilink") gold coins, or (5)
[deposit](Deposit.md "wikilink") gold coins at a
[bank](:Category:_Banks.md "wikilink").

Gold in hand is typically used either (1) to [buy](Buy.md "wikilink")
desired [objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") from
[shopkeepers](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink") or (2) to pay for
other useful services, either from certain
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") (namely,
[etchers](:Category:_Etchers.md "wikilink"),
[healers](:Category:_Healers.md "wikilink"),
[identifiers](:Category:_Identifiers.md "wikilink"), or
[smiths](:Category:_Smiths.md "wikilink")) or in certain
[rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") (namely,
[infirmaries](:Category:_Infirmaries.md "wikilink") or [pet
shops](:Category:_Pet_Shops.md "wikilink")). Note that, when purchasing
things from other [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"),
payment is usually expected in
[gemstones](:Category:_Gemstones.md "wikilink") rather than in gold
coins.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may view their gold in
hand using their [score](Score.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink").
