*The only way to describe this protector is to say he is Veyah's pet.
Born from her blood and sinew, he is less alive even than the skulls he
has smashed. That is not to say he does not have capacity for thought;
indeed, he could often string a sentence or two together to make sure
that the invading High Drow were punished for their insolence.*
