Syntax: cast gravitas (self only) Prerequisites: none

Kinetic masters know best how to defend against their own techniques.
While Gravitas lasts, the next kinetic spell which targets them with an
object is captured. The object or objects wind up in inventory.

Gravitas is exhausted for a short time after it successfully catches
something.
