*Wearing a pitch-black robe and pouring fuel into pots of already
smoking materials, this lizard man hardly notices your presence. You
hear him hissing about his life as a priest and how fed up he is with
praying to gods who do not care. Suddenly he smashes a clay jar on the
ground and stomps on it until it is just dust. Perhaps you should leave
him alone.*
