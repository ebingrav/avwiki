[fletch](Fletch "wikilink") [green arrows](Green_Arrows "wikilink").*

Made of green wood and fletched with leaves, these arrows are magically
enhanced such that they repair themselves, meaning they can never be
destroyed by impact. Although they are weak against armor, their
enchantments make them quite damaging, especially to undead.

Prerequisite(s): none.
