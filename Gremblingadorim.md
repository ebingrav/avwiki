*(Demonic) (Black Aura) A giant dragon snakes through the trees until it
spies you in its way.*

*Giant claws tear at the earth and grapple trees to carry the dragon
further through the forest. Red eyes the size of a melon and the
smoothness of a pearl sit underneath horned and scaled brows. It is
wingless, like many dragons are; the sinuous movements through the trees
make up for it as it travels faster than a horse can run. This is death
for you, adventurous hero.*
