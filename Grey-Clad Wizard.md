*Clad in grey robes of the same shade as the rocks, with a pale face and
hands trenched with the heavy lines of learning, this man does not seem
to have any liking for daylight or joy. Or at least those things always
were less important than the search for knowledge or power. But looking
at what he has accomplished in [this
cavern](:Category:_House_Of_Stone "wikilink"), the achievement of his
aim lies now before him: the overthrow of the rule of the Golden
Citadel, which lies crumpled and broken. He now turns to even grander
pursuits.*
