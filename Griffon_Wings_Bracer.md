*Formed from dried mud collected from the forest floor, this bracer
comes equipped with large [griffon](Griffons.md "wikilink") wings. It's
hard to imagine how someone would come across a
[griffon](Griffons.md "wikilink") in these parts, but perhaps it is just
another show of [hobgoblin](Hobgoblins.md "wikilink") magic. Considering
a [goblin](Goblins.md "wikilink") breed made these, one would be more
than surprised to see if these things actually work.*

[`Armor`` ``class`](Armor_Values.md "wikilink")` is 2-4.`  
`'`[`fly`](Fly.md "wikilink")`' continuous.`
