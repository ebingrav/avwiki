Syntax: groupstat

The groupstat command will display to everyone in your group the number
of characters in the group, and the summed hp, mana and moves of all
characters in the group. Any member of the group may use this command.

Observe that all your groupmembers will see this info and will be
spammed if you do it multiple times.
