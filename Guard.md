## Comments

These mobs get a free round of hits when you attack them, and summon a
variety of guards as back up. They are virtually impossible to kill now
that Lords are shadowed in Midgaardia, and hit extremely hard if not
disarmed.

An Elite Midgaard Townguard wanders, although one appears to be sentinel
at the executioner's block. They can now arrest you in rooms with a Safe
flag, unlike in previous times when only glaring and snarling would
ensue ad nauseum.

Elite Midgaard Townguards are portable. Like all guards, they will
intercede in your favor if you initiate a fight in the same room with
another mob, or if they walk in while a fight is in progress (provided
your alignment is high). If you have a negative alignment, they will
instead assist the mobile and immediately attack you in mid-battle, with
the intention of killing, not jailing.

These guards, along with the wandering lowmort guards
(Death/Light/regular) and sentinel ones posted near Aelmon and the 4
entrances to Midgaard have been phased out.
