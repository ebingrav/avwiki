*If a [berserker](:Category:_Berserkers "wikilink")'s attack is parried
or blocked with a shield, it is more draining to the defender than
normal, thus making it less likely they will be able to defend against
subsequent attacks from both the
[berserker](:Category:_Berserkers "wikilink") and his allies.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: none (automatic).
