## First Guardian

*This male guard was placed in this post after a string of vandalism
that occurred at this particular tomb; he suspects that it was not
vandals but rather a string of invading driders that caused Veyah to
enhance her security in this place. Regardless, the damage was already
done by the time he was placed here, and he stands inside a ruined
shrine that is but a shade of its former glory.*

always searching for driders.

## Second Guardian

*There has not been a break-in in years, but this guard has never
faltered in his duties and he is not about to now. Except... there is a
small part of him, a tiny section, that remembers his life before he
became a guardian of the Tombs, remembers his family, who have probably
grown old and died in the time since he took this job, unknowing of the
risks it entailed. That part only shines through his ever-roaming eyes,
searching for his escape from this post.*
