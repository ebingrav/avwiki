*While not True Fae, Sprites have taken it upon themselves to guard what
precious homeland they and other faerie races share. A long standing
feud between the harpies of Lloth's Peak and the fae races in Midgaardia
has resulted in a new push forward by the Sprites to regain what is
theirs.*

*However the Sprite numbers are few, so they have decided to ask the
help of many midgaardians such as yourself! Those that venture into the
circle will be asked for their assistance, assuming they are strong
enough!*

*This title is bestowed only upon those beings who have reached out and
done their part in the battle to find themselves victorious!*

This insignia shows your dedication the Sprite cause against the attacks
of the harpies from [Lloth's Peak](:Category:Lloth's_Peak "wikilink"),
and your help in securing support of a foreign benevolent party.

For further info, see the [Guardian Of The Fae
Quest](Guardian_Of_The_Fae_Quest "wikilink"). The insignia itself is
nice and shiny, though entirely cosmetic. However, having this insignia
will alter the attitude of certain [Sarphyre's
Court](:Category:Sarphyre's_Court "wikilink") denizens.
