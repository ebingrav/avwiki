A quest in two parts. To start, look for a sprite guarding the entrance
from [Stonehall](:Category:Stonehall.md "wikilink") to [Oak
Circle](:Category:Oak_Circle.md "wikilink") from a tree. Minimum level
is 11. Maximum level unknown.

I completed this quest at level 23. I went to the wrong sprite guardian
first, but she led me to the correct one. The quest is straight forward.
Fol the sprite to get to the area you need to go. For a lowmort or a
player unsure of the areas it's a neat trip around. The guardian shows
you the sights and tells you what directions your going. Once the
guardian drops you off, explore Sarphyre's Court until you find the
Sprite you need to follow. (FYI - it isn't a sprite you need to follow,
it is the Pixie Warlock. Contrary to what the quest giver tells you
there is no orange glow.) Go back to the guardian to get the second part
of the quest. Again you're told what you need to do.. Hint... look for
the waterfall.
