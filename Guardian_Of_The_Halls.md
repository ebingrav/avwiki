*Conscripted by Veyah to guard these seemingly haunted corridors, this
young female elf hopes that her master has kept true to her word, as she
has traveled a long distance for this job, won over by promises of free
food for her family hiding back in the Elven Foothills. She is unable,
however, to brush away the lingering sadness at knowing that she has
lived by magic so long that her family is probably long dead.*
