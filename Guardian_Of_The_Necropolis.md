There are two of these mobs in
[Necropolis](:Category:Necropolis.md "wikilink"). In no specific order:

## First Guardian

*This female protector was one of the first that was assigned to protect
the necropolis. She has seen many things, killed many intruders, but
nothing can prepare her for the dull, dreary life of walking the
corridors over and over, never needing to eat, never needing to rest.
The woman tries to keep herself busy by creating worlds within her mind,
worlds where her family still lives, where she doesn't feel like a
hypocrite for protecting Veyah, where she doesn't wish she had chosen to
take Lloth's side.*
