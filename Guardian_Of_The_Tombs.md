*This guard moves up and down the hallways, trying to keep the
scavengers from getting into the tombs and the lower level, where Veyah
sometimes resides. Sometimes he sees shadows move, and thinks back to
the rumors that driders were invading to bring Veyah to justice - or a
timely death. He never reports such findings to anyone else, though,
afraid that his words might stop their attempt.*

**Keywords:** Guardian.  
**Scan Description:** This guardian's footsteps echo as he marches to
the beat of Veyah.
