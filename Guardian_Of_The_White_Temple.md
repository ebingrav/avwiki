*The guardian of the white temple appears [human](Humans.md "wikilink"),
as your eyes adjust to the light emanating from him. He tells you the
following tale: 'When I was an able boy of 18, I worked for my dad in
the mine. One day I struck out in a new direction, and broke through to
this green meadow here. I followed the meadow to this temple and found
an aged [warrior](:Category:_Warriors.md "wikilink") here garbed as I am
now. He gave me [this sickle](Golden_Sickle.md "wikilink") and robe and
froze me to this spot. He told me that my task was to wait for the day
when a hero would step forth from the mine, and if that hero should
prove worthy, I may find release. He said the exit would be hidden from
all but the chosen ones. You have come through. Show me you are worthy
hero, and best me in combat. The forces of evil rise again, and the land
sings out for a champion. Can you not hear her singing through the
temple? Strike now and prove yourself worthy. If you win seek knowledge
in the runes of [the sickle](Golden_Sickle.md "wikilink") and save [the
cross](White_Marble_Cross.md "wikilink") for dire need. May god be with
you.*'
