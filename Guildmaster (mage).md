*The youthfulness seems to pour out of this apprentice as he
concentrates on his work. But just say the word and he will drop
everything to help a mage adventurer practice a spell or skill.*

*If he is worried about the events in Midgaard that caused the High Mage
Itania to send him to Solace to train mage adventurers, he does not show
it in the least.*
