## Comments

This mob isn't portable as it's in a cursed room. Lots of aggie mobs in
the area but they aren't very big. Mob sees through invis, sneak and
movehidden and is very aggressive.

He wanders the area but seems to re-pop in one of the most north
easterly rooms (Dark Forest).

## Directions

East from [island guard](Island_Guardsman.md "wikilink").

Mob wanders in the cursed area to the north east.
