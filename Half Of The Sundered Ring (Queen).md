*Visions of the Willow Kingdom burst forth, the crystal palace of Avalon
sparkling in the twilight. Yet an inky blackness lurks beyond this
image, her hand commanding an legion of ebony archers. Arrows fly, and
Avalon crumbles to the ground, mortally wounded.*

*But even her own blood, spilled at dawn as Adrial stands over her body,
is not enough to resurrect this now-forgotten place.*

## Comments

This object is used in the creation of the [Once-Sundered
Ring](Once-Sundered_Ring "wikilink").

The only way to tell this ticket apart from [the other
ticket](Half_Of_The_Sundered_Ring_(Duke) "wikilink") needed is by the
description. Previously the halves spawned with 8 hp (Duke) and 10 hp
(Queen), however this was changed some years back and now they both have
8hp. Check description before buying!
