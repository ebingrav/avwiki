## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"):** [Elven
Foothills](:Category:_Elven_Foothills.md "wikilink")
([Map](Elven_Foothills_Map.md "wikilink")).  
**[Room(s)](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink"):** A shaded house
([cursed](Cursed_Rooms.md "wikilink"),
[private](Private_Rooms.md "wikilink")).  
Walking route from [Sol](Sol.md "wikilink"): 3e, 2n, 3e, 9n, w, u, 2s,
w, s, \[e\].  
Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon.md "wikilink"): 14n, 8w, 3n, 6w, 4n,
w, u, 2s, w, s, \[e\].  
Walking route from [Nyad](Nyad.md "wikilink"): 2n, u, 2n, \[e\].  
Although this mob [wanders](Wandering_Mobs.md "wikilink"), it normally
respawns inside "A shaded house" (see walking directions above) with a
closed door. Note that, because its "house" (room) is both
[cursed](Cursed_Rooms.md "wikilink") and
[private](Private_Rooms.md "wikilink"), you will not be able to enter
its house to kill it; instead, you will need to open the door to its
house and then wait patiently for it to emerge before you can kill it.
Also note that, because a half-elven rouge
[sneaks](Sneak.md "wikilink"), you will see no message when it exits its
house and, therefore, you will need to use
[commands](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") like
[look](Look.md "wikilink") or [scan](Scan.md "wikilink") to notice when
it has moved.
