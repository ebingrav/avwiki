## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"):** [Elven

([Map](Elven_Foothills_Map "wikilink")).  
**[Room(s)](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"):** A shaded house
([cursed](Cursed_Rooms "wikilink"),
[private](Private_Rooms "wikilink")).  
Walking route from [Sol](Sol "wikilink"): 3e, 2n, 3e, 9n, w, u, 2s, w,
s, \[e\].  
Walking route from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink"): 14n, 8w, 3n, 6w, 4n, w,

Although this mob [wanders](Wandering_Mobs "wikilink"), it normally
respawns inside "A shaded house" (see walking directions above) with a
closed door. Note that, because its "house" (room) is both
[cursed](Cursed_Rooms "wikilink") and
[private](Private_Rooms "wikilink"), you will not be able to enter its
house to kill it; instead, you will need to open the door to its house
and then wait patiently for it to emerge before you can kill it. Also
note that, because a half-elven rouge [sneaks](Sneak "wikilink"), you
will see no message when it exits its house and, therefore, you will
need to use [commands](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") like
[look](Look "wikilink") or [scan](Scan "wikilink") to notice when it has
moved.
