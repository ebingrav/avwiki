This short quest serves to reset the previously begotten halfling
alignment back to neutral toward both parties - halflings and half-orcs
in [Mountain Tunnels](:Category:Mountain_Tunnels.md "wikilink"),
[Eragora](:Category:Eragora.md "wikilink"). This is done so that the
player will be free to complete the [Mountain Adventurer
Quest](Mountain_Adventurer_Quest "wikilink"), which is otherwise blocked
by the previously started [Halfling Detective
Quest](Halfling_Detective_Quest "wikilink").

    Spy](Halfling_Spy "wikilink"), 2s) will require your services,
    namely to get rid of [Sou f'Fle](Sou_f'Fle "wikilink"), a slayer of
    half-orcs.
-   Teleport to [Mezzo](Mezzo "wikilink") (aggie), e, dispose of Sou
    f'Fle and retrieve his [Necklace Of Half-Orken Teeth And
    Ears](Necklace_Of_Half-Orken_Teeth_And_Ears "wikilink"). Watch out,
    he's not a pushover and wields a poisoned axe.
-   Teleport to [Halfling Spy](Halfling_Spy "wikilink"), 2s, present the
    necklace.
