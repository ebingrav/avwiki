*It begins with a dream - to overtake the 13 Fae of Light at Avalon, to
destroy them once and for all at their most revered point. A cunning
plan to match the dreamer's superior military prowess.*

*And the dream continues on, even when the dreamer dies of a knife
plunged into his sleeping throat. And a smug Zarradyn stands strong -
for a time.*

## Comments

This object is used in the creation of the [Once-Sundered
Ring](Once-Sundered_Ring "wikilink").

The only way to tell this ticket apart from [the other
ticket](Half_Of_The_Sundered_Ring_(Queen) "wikilink") needed is by the
description. Previously the halves spawned with 8 hp (Duke) and 10 hp
(Queen), however this was changed some years back and now they both have
8hp. Check description before buying!
