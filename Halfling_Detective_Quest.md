This quest confers the [Halfling "Detective"
Insignia](Halfling_"Detective"_Insignia "wikilink"), and is located
within [Mountain Tunnels](:Category:Mountain_Tunnels.md "wikilink") on
[Eragora](:Category:Eragora.md "wikilink").

To be eligible to start this quest you must not have done the [Mountain
Adventurer Quest](Mountain_Adventurer_Quest "wikilink"), or if you have,
you must have also done the [Halfling Redemption
Quest](Halfling_Redemption_Quest "wikilink") to nullify it.

The maze portion is very aggressive and tough to CR, so this quest is
only recommended to groups or very large superheroes.

-   Once on Eragora portal to [Halfling Spy](Halfling_Spy "wikilink")
    and examine the bushes. This will trigger the quest.
-   push vegetation, e, s, and from here walk towards the top, scanning
    for the [Nervous Adventurer](Half-Orc_Adventurer.md "wikilink").
    Murder him for the [Commission To Explore The
    Mountains](Commission_To_Explore_The_Mountains "wikilink").
-   Once you reach [Throdak](Throdak "wikilink"), the Paladin's ghost,
    walk d, e, s and pick up the [Misty Elixir](Misty_Elixir "wikilink")
    from the ground.
-   Inside the maze scan for the [Halfling
    Slave](Halfling_Slave "wikilink") ("A halfling searches the area for
    clues"). There are two - one has a [Chocolate
    Egg](Chocolate_Egg "wikilink"), the other has the [Torn Out Journal
    Entry](Torn_Out_Journal_Entry "wikilink"). Kill the one bearing the
    journal (but if you wish to see an easter egg, murder the other one
    as well and give the egg to the paladin's ghost). Both will flee and
    you will need to chase them through the other aggie mobs, making
    this the most tricky part of the quest.
-   Once you have secured all three items, return to Halfling Spy and
    carefully give them to him, one by one.

You will receive the [Halfling "Detective"
Insignia](Halfling_"Detective"_Insignia "wikilink"), congratulations!
This insignia should also have the effect of making the halflings
non-aggressive in your further ventures into the maze.

Once you 999 and no longer require this insignia, consider reverting to
[Mountain Adventurer Insignia](Mountain_Adventurer_Insignia "wikilink")
via the [Half-Orc Redemption
Quest](Half-Orc_Redemption_Quest "wikilink") and then [Mountain
Adventurer Quest](Mountain_Adventurer_Quest "wikilink").
