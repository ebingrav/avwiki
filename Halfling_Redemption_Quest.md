This short quest serves to reset the previously begotten half-orc
alignment back to neutral toward both parties - halflings and half-orcs
in [Mountain Tunnels](:Category:Mountain_Tunnels.md "wikilink"),
[Eragora](:Category:Eragora.md "wikilink"). This is done so that the
player will be free to complete the [Halfling Detective
Quest](Halfling_Detective_Quest "wikilink"), which is otherwise blocked
by the previously started [Mountain Adventurer
Quest](Mountain_Adventurer_Quest "wikilink").

-   [Halfling Spy](Halfling_Spy "wikilink") (portable) will require you
    to retrieve a certain longsword from the bowels of the maze.
-   ''push vegetation', e, s, e, u, n, u, e, d.
-   Scan for the [Mad Adventurer](Mad_Adventurer "wikilink") (*This
    half-orc wanders around, speaking jibberish.*)
-   Kill and loot him, teleport to [Halfling
    Spy](Halfling_Spy "wikilink"), present the [Adventurer's
    Longsword](Adventurer's_Longsword "wikilink").
