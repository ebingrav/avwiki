**Syntax: cast 'hallowed nimbus**'

*The clerics of Quixoltan revere the mighty power of the dragon race and
perhaps more than most appreciate the terrible power these magnificent
creatures command.*

*They have devised an aura spell which protects against fire of all
forms. It will also speed up the recovery time of dragons (and others)
using their racial breath abilities.*

*This is a powerful pantheon spell. Any single cleric can only maintain
(i.e. be the caster of) one of these spells at any given time.*
