*Hans is a very strong [human](Humans "wikilink"), almost as strong as
they run. He is in his late 40's and has jet black hair and a beard. You
get to talking with Hans, and the conversation turns to iron. Hans tells
you that he used to get iron from the old mine in the Murkmire, but the
cave has long since collapsed and become unstable, so now he trades for
it.*
