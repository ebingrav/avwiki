*Hans is a very strong [human](Humans.md "wikilink"), almost as strong
as they run. He is in his late 40's and has jet black hair and a beard.
You get to talking with Hans, and the conversation turns to iron. Hans
tells you that he used to get iron from the old mine in the Murkmire,
but the cave has long since collapsed and become unstable, so now he
trades for it.*
