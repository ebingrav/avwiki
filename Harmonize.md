Syntax: c harmonize <target>

Harmonize changes the alignment of an object to the alignment of the
caster. It can be used on any object, but certain objects are
intrinsically evil and show no effect when this spell is cast on them.

Trying to wrest control of good and evil from the Gods has its
consequences. Occasionally, using this spell will backfire on you. (A
level increase is a possible failure....be warned.)

## Comments

Note: you cannot harmonize an item with a dark flag. In order to change
it's alignment, you'll need to try another method such as fading it
(e.g., via enchant armor/weapon) or spending questpoints.
