Harmonizing, or "Harming" is a lord level ability that realigns the
target item to the caster's alignment. If the caster is aligned good, it
removes the [Anti-Good flag](Anti-Good_Flag.md "wikilink") (if it is on
the item) and replaces it with [Anti-Evil](Anti-Evil_Flag.md "wikilink")
and [Anti-Neutral](Anti-Neutral_Flag.md "wikilink"). If the caster is
aligned evil, it removes the [Anti-Evil
flag](Anti-Evil_Flag.md "wikilink") and replaces it with
[Anti-Good](Anti-Good_Flag.md "wikilink") and
[Anti-Neutral](Anti-Neutral_Flag.md "wikilink"). Please note that items
with the [Dark flag](Dark_Flag.md "wikilink") cannot be harmed, and
require [fading](Fading.md "wikilink") if you wish to change their
alignment.
