Harmonizing, or "Harming" is a lord level ability that realigns the
target item to the caster's alignment. If the caster is aligned good, it
removes the [Anti-Good flag](Anti-Good_Flag "wikilink") (if it is on the
item) and replaces it with [Anti-Evil](Anti-Evil_Flag "wikilink") and
[Anti-Neutral](Anti-Neutral_Flag "wikilink"). If the caster is aligned
evil, it removes the [Anti-Evil flag](Anti-Evil_Flag "wikilink") and
replaces it with [Anti-Good](Anti-Good_Flag "wikilink") and
[Anti-Neutral](Anti-Neutral_Flag "wikilink"). Please note that items
with the [Dark flag](Dark_Flag "wikilink") cannot be harmed, and require
[fading](Fading "wikilink") if you wish to change their alignment.
