Healers play a vital roll in not only the health and performance of the
Tank, but the entire group. With a constant stream of healing spells and
(usually) large stores of mana to draw upon, the Healer can often turn
an impossible situation into a large chunk of experience. Also, Healers
serve as a mid-run speller. When [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink")
falls, the Healer is generally the first to renew it. When a
[Hitter](Hitters.md "wikilink") needs a quick
[Frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink") during battle, they call on the Healer.

While all [Clerics](Cleric.md "wikilink") are Healers, not all Healers
are [Clerics](Cleric.md "wikilink"). One musn't overlook other classes
skilled in [Read Magic](Read_Magic "wikilink") and [Arcane
Knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge "wikilink"), as they can also provide health
for the group in the form of [Brandishes](Brandish.md "wikilink"). Just
remember, a Wizard that's [Brandishing](Brandish.md "wikilink") healies
is generally less effective than a true Cleric, so try to cut them a
little slack.
