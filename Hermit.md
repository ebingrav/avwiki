*"Greetings!" Says Groot, a self-proclaimed hermit. Dressed in colorful
shirt and pants he doesn't really fit the part. And of course there is
the fact that he seems happy to see you. Something you don't see often
with reclusives. He notices the incredulous look on your face and grins.
"You expected someone in sheepskin clothes with unkempt hair and beard!
Sorry to disappoint you, my friend, but I guess I am a different type of
hermit. I prefer the smell of nature around me, and like to ponder the
questions of life as much as any other misanthrope... But I don't
believe it should cut into my personal living standards!" He invites you
to spend some time here, claiming he likes to hear about the happenings
in the world out there.*
