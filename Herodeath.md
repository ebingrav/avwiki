Heroes, Lords, Legends and Titans have an added danger in regards to
death. It is possible to lose an attribute point in Strength,
Intelligence, Dexterity, Constitution and Wisdom upon death. It is not a
guarantee, but it is an added danger, in addition to those faced by all.
Low Mortals and Heroes below sublevel 101 are protected from this
danger.
