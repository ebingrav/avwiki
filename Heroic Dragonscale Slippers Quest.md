1\. Look at the [Far Hunter](Far_Hunter "wikilink") before you depart to
the [Rim](:Category:Rim "wikilink").  
2. Look at him again once you arrive, to reiterate what he wants.  
<spoiler> 3. Find the [storm wyrm
Oeheliu](Storm_Wyrm_Oeheliu "wikilink") and eliminate it. It hunts
beyond the Fog through several mazes. To reach it, enter the Fog (See
the [area page](:Category:Rim "wikilink") for more info), then traverse
the fog by scanning for fog-specific mobs or imps/mephits that live in
the Windless Sea. Once in the Windless Sea (hopefully with enough
hp/mana remaining to survive for a WHILE longer, traverse this random
maze until you find a set of north-south connected rooms. Requires an
east, then west, then south. Look for dragons and possible an elemental
sea stalker. Strangely calm waters. At the very south end is the Storm
Wyrm. Murder it.  
4. Return with the ticket to the Far Hunter. He will give you a scale.  
5. [Jake The Thorn-Slayer](Jake_The_Thorn-Slayer "wikilink") will accept
it.  
</spoiler> 6. Receive [Heroic Dragonscale
Slippers](Heroic_Dragonscale_Slippers "wikilink")

As all Rim involvements, this one is tough to solo. Be VERY careful,
have insured gear and the morgue enabled.
