Syntax: herothank Syntax: herothank <character>

Herothank alone, will tell you who you have THANKed, and how many times
you've BEEN THANKed.

HEROTHANK <character> will let you ONCE in your lifetime thank a Hero
who has helped you significantly. This will award him/her/it a variety
of gifts. This is a reward for those Heroes who instead of leveling,
choose to look out for their fellow beings. Since they do not spend time
leveling, it's difficult to gain stats, or lower the cost of spells,
etc., so this command may be used to aid them if they deserve your
gratitude.

You don't have the ability to herothank until you are level 25. And
realize that once you have used your herothank , you will NOT have
another one. So, don't merely thank the first [Hero](Hero "wikilink")
who does a [CR](CR "wikilink") for you or gets you equipment, but give
it to a deserving [hero](hero "wikilink"). Also don't feel like you have
to use your Herothank just because a [Hero](Hero "wikilink") comes to
your aid.. or asks you for it. It's yours to do with as you see fit.
(Heroes are limited to only receive up to 25 thanks.)

NOTE: Herothank ONLY works on Heroes, NOT Lowmorts, Lords, Angels, or
Immortals.

Herothank will give the recipient either two [hit
points](Hit_Points "wikilink"), [mana points](Mana_Points "wikilink"),
[move points](Move_Points "wikilink") or [practice
points](Practice_Points "wikilink") at random.
