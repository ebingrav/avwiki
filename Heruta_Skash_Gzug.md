## Comments

One of the five masters. Rewards roughly 150xp to a hero worshipping
[shizaga](Shizaga "wikilink"). He carries some other stuff besides the
[nectar](nectar "wikilink") - [hooded black
robe](hooded_black_robe "wikilink") (mana +25) is evil aligned gear,
while the [Gold Chased Armor](Gold_Chased_Armor "wikilink") (mana +50)
he carries is not (excellent mana gear). 2.mast or gz will work for
targetting, but the other mobs in the room are good xp, so go for gold
and kill all of them. None of them
[assist](Assist "wikilink")/[aggie](Aggressive "wikilink"), but some are
casters, and can hit a lowhero pretty hard with a
[disintegrate](Disintegrate "wikilink").

## Directions

From [Vapul](Vapul "wikilink") (Warning: [AGGIE](Aggressive "wikilink"))
