*Tall, thin to the point of being scrawny, this male sneaks about,
searching for his relatives. He has no children of his own, but he spent
most of his life doting on his aunt's son - someone that the entire
family took pride in, someone that everyone thought was going to go far.
But no one had heard from either the boy or his mother, so he came to
the necropolis for answers. It is a good thing that he perished here,
some might say, because he was spared the evils that befell those who
stayed behind.*
