There are 5 of these mobs in
[Necropolis](:Category:Necropolis "wikilink"). In no specific order:

## First Child

*A tiny, malnourished figure stands in the corner. He looks to be an
older child stuck in a infant's body, barely coming up to a human's
knee. His steps are mostly true, however, though he barely moves when
the torchlight hits him, preferring to stay in the shadows where no one
can see his monstrous face.*

**Keywords:** High, Drow, Child.  
**Scan Description:** This figure hides in the shadows, away from the
flickering torchlight.

## Second Child

*This tiny child is probably too newly-born to realize that he is High
Drow. His clothes are in shambles and he spends most of his time staring
blankly in front of him. The boy shifts his feet, restless. He raises
his hands, and a second later an assault of memories flow into the air.
Just the edges of them, nothing major - the few memories of his family
he has left, contoured by a child's mind, and a handful of memories of
the moments before his death.*

**Keywords:** High, Drow, Child.  
**Scan Description:** Surrounded by spinning memories, this child barely
notices reality.

## Third Child

*This High Drow child had just begun to learn to walk when she was
slain. Her steps are wobbly and uncertain, but the child tries; when she
slips, she grabs onto the mud-thick walls to steady herself. Those hands
are impeccably clean of any dirt, however, though the once rich curls
that adorned her tiny head are now damp and lifeless. The girl hums a
soft ditty under her breath, not noticing you.*

**Keywords:** High, Drow, Child.  
**Scan Description:** Stumbling along, this child somehow manages to
keep her balance.

## Fourth Child

*This female High Drow is a child slightly older than most found in
these accursed walls; her eyes seem to hold some intelligence of what
has happened to her and her race, but beyond that they are dull and
lifeless when it comes to her surroundings. Her hair is covered in
little flecks of ice, and her fair skin has turned a distinct tint of
blue from the cold. When she moves, the movements are jerky and
uncertain, as if she had gotten into a fight with some of the guards.*

**Keywords:** High, Drow, Child.  
**Scan Description:** A vacant look is the only thing to escape the
prison of child's eyes.  
**[Level](Level "wikilink"):** ??.  
**[Alignment](Alignment "wikilink"):** Saintly.  
**[Flags](:Category:_Mob_Types "wikilink"):**

## Fifth Child

*This child slips to the ground, her arms hugging her knees as she rocks
back and forth, perhaps trying to forget all that she has seen, all that
she has heard. Her sheen-white hair had been cropped close to her ears
when her mother tried to pass her off as a boy to prevent the girl's
murder. She failed, it seems, as Veyah ordered the death of all High
Drow - man, woman, and child, not just those who can bear more heirs to
the race.*

**Keywords:** High, Drow, Child.  
**Scan Description:** Swaying, this child collapses to the ground,
overcome by emotion.  
**[Level](Level "wikilink"):** 65.  
**[Alignment](Alignment "wikilink"):** Saintly.  
**[Flags](:Category:_Mob_Types "wikilink"):**

## Comments

The fifth child as listed above gives you the following message when you
kill him:  
*The child begins to sway, but at the last moment, her body is
transformed. Before you stands not a High Drow child, but rather one of
Veyah's minions, who sneers at you with disdain. "So you found out my
secret. You will pay, you will pay," he whispers as he rushes you,
closing the distance in an instant...*  
Then [One Of Veyah's Spies](One_Of_Veyah's_Spies "wikilink") pops in
front of you (note: the spy's aggie).
