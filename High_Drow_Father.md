*This man's salt and pepper hair has been pulled back into a tight,
short ponytail, and he walks with a sure stride - though he does not
seem to be getting very far. Every few feet, his left hand anxiously
plays with a large ruby ring he placed on his right ring finger. The
rest of the time, his hands are spent searching the walls for some
hidden passage back to his wife and children - he holds tight to the
belief that they are still alive, that they are just hiding somewhere in
this abyss.*
