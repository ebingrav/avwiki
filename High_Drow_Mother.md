There are five different mothers, all in
[Necropolis](:Category:Necropolis "wikilink"). In no specific order:

## First Mother

*Pacing back and forth, this lady seems caught in a rash of horrible
decisions, and her hands seemingly wring themselves as she is lost in
this nightmare. Her usually braided hair is wildly billowing around her
head with every breath of wind that slashes past. She relives the moment
that she realized she was betrayed, the moment each of her three
children died - the younger ones succumbed to magic, but the oldest was
more defiant, and died to a physical blade wielded by one of the
executioners of Veyah.*

## Second Mother

*The tears from this mother's eyes have long frozen against her skin as
she hurries along from corridor to corridor. Even she is not certain
what she is searching for, but the woman cannot rest. Searching for
revenge? Her dead children? Her old life? Her dress swishes against her
legs as she stalks past, but she takes no notice of you. She barely
remembers dying, barely remembers the pain of being separated from her
family in the afterlife.*

## Third Mother

*Overcome with grief, this mother spends more time crying than
breathing, it seems. She walks slowly, her shoulders hunched over, and
mutters incoherent phrases to herself every few seconds. The woman is
adorned in clothes more fitting for royalty, but it seems that she has
not been spared the same fate the other families faced. The mother saw
the invading driders scuttle past and hopes they will enact some sort of
justice where none of the High Drow could.*

**Keywords:** High, Drow, Mother.

in frustration.

## Fourth Mother

*This woman never would have considered herself a mother first and
foremost, but after the birth of her first child - a daughter - she
began to feel her heart melt as the days passed. Six months later, and
she found herself entranced by the girl's spell. Lured to the necropolis
by a possible blessing for her child, she found herself betrayed by
Veyah and her child dead. Now, she cannot remember what life was like
before her little one, before the priestess became drunk with the idea
of being a demigoddess just like Lloth.*

**Keywords:** High, Drow, Mother.

only child.

## Fifth Mother

*This young woman came hoping for a peaceful resolution to what she
thought was only the temporary insanity of Veyah, but found herself
dying as a result. Now she spends her time trying to find both her
daughter and the last token of her family... a picture that she had
hoped to show to the priestess to change her mind. She knows that she
buried it somewhere when she realized her goal was impossible, and now
she cannot remember where it is since all of the hallways and corridors
have begun to look alike.*

she lost.
