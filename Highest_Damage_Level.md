''At the bottom of your score, there is a line that looks like:

`Highest Damage Level:        DAUNTING`

*This word is determined by the hardest single hit to date that your
character has made. It has no bearing on anything else in life.*

*Hits scored during a [HoGathon](Hogathons "wikilink") do not count.*

*You can reset your HDL by typing [config](Config "wikilink") hdl.*

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may view their HDL using
their [score](Score "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink").
