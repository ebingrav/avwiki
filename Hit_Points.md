*Hit points are arguably the most important statistic in a fight. If you
reach 0 hp, you go unconscious. When you hit -10 hit points, you die.
You'll lose fewer hp if your '[armor class](Armor_Class.md "wikilink")'
is lower (which is better), and if certain damage-reducing spells are
affecting you.*
