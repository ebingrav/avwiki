*The term hitter is used to define all members of a group who are not
[tanking](Tanks.md "wikilink") or [healing](Healers.md "wikilink"). The
role of the hitter (or hitters) in the group is to inflict damage onto
the [mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"), and as such hitters can be of
any [class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") and will usually wear
[equipment to maximize their damage](:Category:_Hit_Gear.md "wikilink")
to the mob. In contrast the role of the [healer](Healers.md "wikilink")
is to keep the [tank](Tanks.md "wikilink") and group healthy, with any
damage they inflict a bonus. The distinction between hitter and
[healer](Healers.md "wikilink") means that a
[cleric](:Category:_Clerics.md "wikilink") is not necessarily a
[healer](Healers.md "wikilink") in a group, nor are characters of other
[classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") precluded from the role of
[healer](Healers.md "wikilink").*

See also [Healers](Healers.md "wikilink") and
[Tanks](Tanks.md "wikilink").
