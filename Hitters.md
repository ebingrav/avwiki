*The term hitter is used to define all members of a group who are not
[tanking](Tanks "wikilink") or [healing](Healers "wikilink"). The role
of the hitter (or hitters) in the group is to inflict damage onto the
[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"), and as such hitters can be of any
[class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") and will usually wear [equipment
to maximize their damage](:Category:_Hit_Gear "wikilink") to the mob. In
contrast the role of the [healer](Healers "wikilink") is to keep the
[tank](Tanks "wikilink") and group healthy, with any damage they inflict
a bonus. The distinction between hitter and [healer](Healers "wikilink")
means that a [cleric](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") is not necessarily
a [healer](Healers "wikilink") in a group, nor are characters of other
[classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") precluded from the role of
[healer](Healers "wikilink").*

See also [Healers](Healers "wikilink") and [Tanks](Tanks "wikilink").
