*Such wealth as you see before your eyes is difficult to imagine, even
for the greediest of [dwarves](Dwarves.md "wikilink"). The
[goblins](Goblins.md "wikilink") who have inhabited [these
caverns](:Category:_Goblin_Caverns.md "wikilink") for eons have amassed
extraordinary amounts of treasure from any passing party. As your mind
is bent on obtaining this treasure, you fail to realize that you could
spend a lifetime trying to get it.*
