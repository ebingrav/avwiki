*His job is to protect the masters in the deepest bowels of the tree
from being disturbed. Apparently there was an trial earlier, but based
on the screams he heard recently, it didn't sound like a very successful
ascension.*

## Gear

`A hobgoblin guard is using:`  
<held in offhand>`   `[`a`` ``crude`` ``shield`` ``of`` ``branches`](Crude_Shield_Of_Branches "wikilink")  
<wielded>`           a thorn bush`

## Comments

There are multiple hobgoblin guards in the area, but only one has the
shield.

The thorn bush has negative modifiers, so it is not a desirable piece of
gear.
