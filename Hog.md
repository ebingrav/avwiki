*HOG is an acronym for [Hand of God](Hand_Of_God.md "wikilink"). HOG
drastically boosts melee [damage](Damage.md "wikilink"). Your
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") is otherwise unaltered.
The [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") is available only
during Avatar's famed [hog-a-thons](Hogathons.md "wikilink").*

Syntax: hog.

When this mode is enabled, a player can type in hog and receive a 20k
boost to hr/dr. This will make you kill the majority of mobs in one
round, with only a handful being able to survive damage that surpasses
vaporizing. There are also two types of hogs, announced and spontaneous.
The announced ones usually run for an hour, while the latter type might
last less than a minute for the chance to type in hog and get the 24 tic
bonus to hr/dr.
