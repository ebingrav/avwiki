*Hog-a-thons are free-for-all quests in which all participants receive
the [Hand of God](Hand_Of_God "wikilink")
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink"). They generally last an hour and
are announced. Hog-a-thons are very rare and it is considered rude (even
punishable) to ask for one. Here are some tips for hog-a-thon
participants:*

-   *[HOG](Hand_Of_God "wikilink") is removed when you
    [level](Level "wikilink"), [die](Death "wikilink"), or
    [save](Save "wikilink"). Type [hog](Hog "wikilink") again to
    reactivate it.*
-   *Losses during hog-a-thons are not reimbursable.
    [Insured](Insure "wikilink") [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")
    lost in a crash are the only exception.*
-   *It will lag. To reduce lag, do not spam, turn on
    [brief](Brief "wikilink"), [battleself](Battleself "wikilink"),
    [battleother](Battleother "wikilink"), and filters, and turn off
    [channels](:Category:_Channels "wikilink").*
-   *[Death](Death "wikilink") is inevitable. If you do not want a
    [CR](Corpse_Retrieval "wikilink"), say so in your
    [title](Title "wikilink"). Be patient. The
    [angels](:Category:_Angels "wikilink") will help you as soon as
    possible. Remember to [detect invisibility](Detect_Invis "wikilink")
    when retrieving [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") from your
    corpse.*
-   *[Mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") will be scarce. Learn to walk
    and utilize [recall](Recall "wikilink") set.*
-   *[Hit points](Hit_Points "wikilink"),
    [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink"), and [movement
    points](Move_Points "wikilink") will be scarce. Stock up on useful
    [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink").*
-   *Consider leaving your best gear on an alternate character and
    running with just a pair of basic weapons.*
-   *Have fun.*

More tips:

-   Run in ac gear. You don't need any hr/dr bonuses, or mana really. AC
    gear will help you dodge blows and go longer in harder places.
-   Abuse your skills: BZKs and SHFs can go forever without stopping, go
    to a hard area. EHAs are great for these two classes since they
    regenerate their hp with kills.
-   Go to harder areas that you're familiar with: taking superheroes
    through lowhero areas is fine, just you're getting less xp, and
    those tiny people using the hog are denied areas they can handle.
-   Keeping sanc up can be a life saver.
-   Remember to wear leveling gear.
