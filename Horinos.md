"The old monk leans heavily on a desk filled with parchments and
scribbles. But the gaze of his tear-smeared eyes does not hold anything
near. He seems to look into some distant place or past. A momentary
smile slips across his features, like the sun piercing through dark grey
clouds. But that moment is gone very soon. He frowns and shakes his
head, noticing you for the first time.

`   'Hail strangers, you have come to mock me too? Noone believes.`  
`    The captain of the guard says that a monk fleeing into the`  
`    night is no matter of importance to this keep. Fleeing! As`  
`    if Ignos would flee! But no, we are not to say anything about`  
`    the incident, about demons! And now, now that that creature`  
`    of the night has stolen into the abandoned house, into the`  
`    very room where that man was killed and Ignos taken, noone`  
`    dares to go and look for any hints, hints about where to go`  
`    and find Ignos, poor poor Ignos, oh my God, oh why ...'`

With that his voice and attention drift away again"

None.  

### Comments

Horinos is involved in at least two quests in his search for Ignos. The
first quest takes you to his room that has been ravaged by a werewolf.
Once you bring back some hints of Ingos' whereabouts Horinos will attemt
to seek his friend with magic and give you another clue as to where he
might be. This will lead you to the caverns of
[Obelische](:Category:_Obelische_Caverns "wikilink") where you seek the
last part of Ignos' cross. Bring it back and give it to Horinos to
recieve a gift.
