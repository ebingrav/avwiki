*An elderly [high elf](High_Elves "wikilink") stands here leaning on
[his staff](Healer's_Staff "wikilink"). He has made the climb to
[lord](:Category:Lord "wikilink") twice, first as an
[elven](Elves "wikilink") [cleric](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink"), then
as a [high-elf](High_Elves "wikilink"). Both times he has given it up to
return to the lower realms in a new form. This time, after learning the
ways of [the priest](:Category:_Priests "wikilink"), he has eschewed
battle in any form and remained at [the
hospice](:Category:_Tul-Sith's_Hospice "wikilink") as a teacher. Now he
is the director of [the
hospice](:Category:_Tul-Sith's_Hospice "wikilink"), overseeing the care
and learning of his flock.*
