Prerequisites: [shred](shred "wikilink") </br>Syntax: none

Never let the prey escape! When fighting with their claws, a Ripper with
this skill will have a chance to gain a follow-up attack whenever their
target dodges.

This skill does not loop. If the follow-up attack is dodged, it does not
generate an additional follow-up.

The chances of a hound attack are increased against an enemy who has
been [Flayed](Flay "wikilink").
