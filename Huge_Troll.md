*Saliva dripping from the edges of her mouth, the leader of the
[troll](Trolls.md "wikilink") scouting party looks down upon you with
obvious disgust. 'I should just eat you. But you just might come in
handy, now that you have come past my guards... Look at me, at my size!
I DO need some cloth that fit me. Well, not just any cloth, some armor
which hides my features, and it should look good too. What?! You don't
want to? You better get me that stuff so that I can finally lead my
scouts to [Mt. Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr.md "wikilink"). We have been
delayed too long already. Or maybe, maybe I should just eat you
anyway...' Sucking some brain out of [the
skull](Human_Skull_(Odevar_Hills).md "wikilink") she holds in her claws,
she waves at you to leave her alone.*
