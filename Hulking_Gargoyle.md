*You'd better turn around and go, now! Run! - The beast is just immense,
larger than a giant even now that it rests its arms upon the cavern
floor. And the rock it is made of appears to be lined with traces of
red. It could be just veins in the stone, but it could just as well be
blood. Or both. It sounds like a great idea to go closer and find out -
if you are tired of living that is.*
