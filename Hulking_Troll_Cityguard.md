*The troll's menacing silhouette, embellished by the numerous spikes
embedded in its armor, stands out easily among the surrounding
citizenry. He marches from streetcorner to streetcorner, looking for
potential troublemakers.*

## Comments

The level of this mob is absurdly high, and combined with sanctuary
makes it unsoloable under almost any circumstances. Get a party if
you're interested in taking it down. Since it is a lawful mob, attacking
it will trigger outlaw flag, and since it's a townguard it will take you
to jail instead of obliterating you into dust. Most of the time.
