*Only marginally lessening her attention for the hunting dogs below the
hunter says to you:  
  
'You have come hunting to this place? Well, it is not the right place.
Yes, the hounds are howling, just like I heard it in my dreams. But the
colour of the fur -'  
  
The slim figure finally turns to you, almost disappearing in the soft
fur-coat of bright colours. The gaze darting at you from the deep shadow
feels quite disturbing, and it takes a moment to realize that this might
be due to the different colour of the eyes.  
  
'Somewhere in the north there is a big wolf that haunts my dreams,
howling with the pack. A bright white is the colour of its fur. And the
eyes... I beg you, fellow hunter, when you happen onto that beast, slay
it quickly and bring me its head. Before he is fully gone..'  
  
With that she returns her focus onto the dogs, obviously still hoping to
find a hint of the wolf here...*
