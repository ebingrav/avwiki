*Also called a killer whale, this orca is easiliy identifiable by its
distinctive black and white markings. While some orcas tend to live
close to land, this particular one is part of an offshore pod of several
hundred. With an essentially unlimited range, they spend their days
nomadically crossing the Realm's oceans, stopping occasionally to hunt
in packs, as they have done here.*
