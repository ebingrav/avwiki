*When fighting, it is only natural to have a sense of morality. After
killing something that is considered "evil" or "good", adrenaline rushes
into a part of the brain that triggers a sense of placement within the
universe.*

*Why not give that a little nudge? As a Psion, you can do just that and
the result is what can only be called hypermorality. Luckily this is not
a prolonged effect because it is quite possible that a prolonged change
would drive someone insane.*

Prerequisites: None

Syntax: cast 'hypermorality' <character>
