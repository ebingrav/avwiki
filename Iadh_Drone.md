spade-like blades for digging. It slinks along the tunnel, barely in
sight.*

### Comments

Psions should be frugal with their use of [dancing
weapon](Dancing_Weapon.md "wikilink"), as these mobs scavenge, flee, and
sneak.

Twenty iadh drones populate the colony section of Gorn's Anchor. This
section is cursed, and has a one-way entrance.
[Teleporting](Teleport.md "wikilink"),
[portaling](Portal.md "wikilink"), or fighting one's way through the
colony are the only ways out.
