*This iadh is some sort of overseer for its colony. The overseer's arms
and legs are withered in comparison to the workers and warriors, as if
they have never been used. It hovers gently above the floor of the
cavern, keeping watch over the area and directing fellow iadh.*

### Comments

Two iadh overseers wander the colony section of Gorn's Anchor, with
different short descriptions:  
**A taller iadh oversees its underlings.** and **A taller iadh floats
toward you.**

The iadh overseer is of a high enough level to cast
[detonate](Detonate "wikilink").

The area populated by iadh overseers is cursed, and has a one-way
entrance. [Teleporting](Teleport "wikilink"),
[portaling](Portal "wikilink"), or fighting one's way through the iadh
colony are the only ways out.
