*This creature is an iadh, a race of very large, very aggressive
insects. Standing on four legs with two arms curled in front of it, it
bears resemblance to an insectoid centaur. The iadh has a layered
leathery carapace, and each of its limbs are dangerously barbed at the
joints. It stands curiously still, and without any visible eyes it's
impossible to tell whether it's sleeping or not.*

Three iadh sentries populate the entrance to the iadh tunnels, between
the volcano's peak and the one-way entrance to the colony.

One of the sentries is awake.
