See [Gear In Shunned
World](:Category:Gear_In_Shunned_World.md "wikilink") for how to do this
run.

## Directions

The Gray staff and [Katar Forged From
Kzintium](Katar_Forged_From_Kzintium "wikilink") share the same first
half, with slightly different directions to get to where you first need
to be. If you agree to do the Katar questline, the Gray Staff will be
un-doable until next reboot.

### Part One

Do the [Sceptre of Blazing Fury](Sceptre_of_Blazing_Fury "wikilink")
run. You need the [Flame of Imix](Flame_of_Imix "wikilink") to burn the
documents. Best to do this first so that you can lotto the
sceptre/balteus/qp runes, and not force your group to commit to a three
spellup run.

### Part Two

1\. From shift, head all west into the Shunned World. Head up, then work
your way northwest and up and until you reach the room "At the edge of
the village square." Head n2w from here to reach the Elder. Agree with
him to start the Gray Staff quest.

2\. Make your way back out into the jungle, then head towards the mines
as on the katar run. The easiest way to do this is to leave shunned
world, then go all north, then go east until scan shows a kzinti warrior
north of you. Keep heading north until scan shows a Kzin scientist north
of you. From here, head all east, all north, and east to enter the
mines.

The following steps are copied/pasted from Katar.

3\. Mines are generally "U" shaped with you entering the mines the upper
right side. Head south and west til you see Raskartan and a couple of
other mobs in the way. Not a hard room but best to send in a tank and
have a backup tank in the wings for this room. (btw if you avoid all the
miners actively mining, not the ones just wandering looking for a place
to mine you won't set off any of the alarms.)

4\. Entrance to the spire is just a bit north west of the large room you
had to get by.

5\. You can regen in room with the peaceful kzinti. He will give you 5
choices of directions.

-   Take what you bring - No regen path, bonus is regen room right
    before final room because a safe room
-   Might makes right - No spell path, bonus is majority of gear room
    doesn't have sanc. Can cast in gear room and regen room just fine.
-   All is lost - Shortest path but it is a maze, no modifications to
    gear room or regen room
-   Power is everything - melee immune path, extra big ass gassy mob
    added to gear room but he has pgems. Gear room is silent. Requires a
    very good group to even consider.
-   Win some, lose some - det path, small det mobs added to path that do
    not repop. Det mob is removed from gear room.

If you have a strong enough group, you should definitely do the "Power
is Everything" (Up) Path, as the path itself is not too much harder than
the noregen (North) path. After you choose a path, the peaceful kzin
will take a little time to lower the barrier. Once he says the barrier
is weakened, you can push barrier to proceed.

**The following information is valid ONLY on the "Power is Everything"
(Up) Path.**

-   Only the kzinti ghosts on this path are melee immune, the horde of
    rats and other swarms are able to be damaged by melee.
-   To navigate the path itself, choose a direction to go and never
    backtrack, then take the up and down exits as they become available
    to you.
-   Right before the gear room is a room containing lots of imps that
    can be immolated by your sors. There is also one aggie mob here, so
    do NOT areaspell in this room.
-   The room contains one mob that dets, the cloud. Have your sors/mnds
    target that first until it dies so that you can wear gear again. It
    is best to send a (naked) bzk first along with the burning hands
    pill from Eragora so that you can abuse Resist Pain and huge hp
    until the cloud dies. Have your ac tanks wear their gear after the
    cloud is dead (checkable by looking at the cloud until you can no
    longer see it).
-   The gear room's gas is quite painful; you will probably need augment
    2 preach comf to survive until the gassy mob dies.
-   **Your bonus for taking this path is 1 lord level pgem of each
    type.**

If you choose to take this path, the room will still be silenced after
it is clear. Instruct your group members to plane thorn after the room
is clear, then salv your bzk (or strand them there for hilarity). Make
sure to "take all corpse" from all the corpses before you leave to
ensure that everything is looted.

6\. Keep the documents from the gear room, and save them until you are
ready to run next part. Loot should be: Circlet, Documents, Gloves,
Sceptre (included in any path)

### Part Three

1\. Make your way back to the Elder in Shunned world. Give him the
documents, then the Flame of Imix when he asks for the flame from the
Volcano.

2\. Follow the Elder when he prompts you to be taken deeper into Shunned
world. He will give you a warning not to kill any of the villagers; if
you do, you are dragged out and warned about how you screwed up, but he
will give you a second chance in exchange for a pyrolisk heart. No real
harm seems to be done though. Still, best not to kill any villagers to
not get your group fragmented. Have your rogues turn off their stab
triggers to be safe.

(More recent info suggests that killing a villager will summon a
legend-sized mob who wrecks the whole group, which doesn't match the
info above. Hey, try it out and write down what you learn!)

3\. The goal of this section is to get a key. It is carried by a
completely invisible (no glowing red eyes) stabber, [a
killer](a_killer "wikilink"). Killing any killer will drop a key. Note
that the killer is NOT carrying the key in his inventory. When you see
the message "The light catches on a silvery speck," that killer has
spawned the key and it is on the ground. Pick it up!

4\. Make your way north-ish until you find a locked north. North is the
gear room. The safest place to regen is 1e from this room. Don't unlock
the door yet!

5\. Once regen'd, go 1w to reach the door again. If there are any mobs
in the room, wait for them to move/die before you attempt to unlock the
door. This run suffers the same problem as Katar where the key has 1-2
uses and it can break before opening the door if you're unlucky.

6\. The gear room is north. It has 7 mobs; a sorcerer, a shadows, and 5
bodyguards. Spells to watch out for here are demonfire, dread (can
really screw you up if your lead tank gets dreaded), and migraine. The
gear room isn't that bad (no "room goes no-spell in 4-5 rounds) overall.
The loot you are looking for are the left and right halves of a token.

7\. Make your way southeast and back into the village. Give the Elder
both halves of the token and he will give you the gray staff. Also on
the run are some items ([Essence Of Magic](Essence_Of_Magic "wikilink")
and [Essence Of Shadows](Essence_Of_Shadows "wikilink")), which are
about body mana and t2 leg ac, respectively.

8\. For some reason the village is entirely anti-magic. To get out, head
2esd to reach a room where you can planeshift.
