*Icytree is by far the largest person you've seen in Icewolf, human or
otherwise. He is a legendary hunter, continuing the lineage of his
family. They have always produced the strongest, smartest, and most
skilled hunters, and Icytree is no exception. He is near seven feet tall
but there is nothing lanky about him. Despite his size he moves with an
uncanny grace. He rarely takes part in hunts though he would dearly love
to do so. His time is taken up with defending the city and taking care
of the law now that Icewolf has experienced an influx of people. Icytree
has become a captain of the guard of sorts for Icewolf.*
