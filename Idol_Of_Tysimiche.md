(White Aura) (Sneak) From atop its pedestal, a golden monkey statue
leers at you.

The ancient Karnathians recognized Tysimiche as an avatar of Shizaga in
her aspect as the Goddess of Luck. This golden statue stares at you with
an unnerving grin, as if she knows something that you do not. The idol
of Tysimiche is in perfect health.

Accessed from this room:

An ancient, desiccated riverbed  
\[Exits: north east up\]  
As the sun strikes the chips in the cliff faces it casts an irregular
pattern of dark shadows against the bleached white walls. The air, while
dry, weighs heavily upon you. A persistent feeling of unease gnaws at
your gut. Interlopers are not meant to tread in this place.  
(Sharp) A small pile of cactus needles eyes your exposed flesh
hungrily.  
A crater sits at the base of the cliff.

Ran around from anchor southwestish, pulled a chain, opened a west,
closed east, room with no exits (not necessarily a safe room --
Tysimiche assists). Here is the following text. You give the idol of
Tysimiche 3 coins.

The idol of Tysimiche asks '3 is a very lucky number! Did you know
that?'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'There's 3 other numbers which are also
special to me.'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'These three numbers may pop into your head
during a moment of quiet examination.'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'However, they will only reveal themselves to
you in certain locations.'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'There are nearby places where the holy
numbers are embedded into the very spirit of the land itself.'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'Since this is a difficult task, I will give
you some hints as to where these places are.'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'The first number awaits discovery as you
approach the sacred valley.'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'The second number is hidden high above the
gulch, where beautiful vistas can be had.'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'The final number is entrusted to an Icon of
the Goddess of Tranquility.'

The idol of Tysimiche says 'I hope I didn't make this task too easy for
you.'

Note: 666 is a VERY UNLUCKY NUMBER. Tysimiche attacks by casting
soulcrush on you.

1\. A lucky number 2. A soothing number that yields relief 3. ??
