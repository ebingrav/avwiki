*This Rite is a more advanced form of Resist Pain. It absorbs almost all
melee damage during the first round of melee, and the affect wears off
more slowly. It does not stack with its lesser relative; only the more
powerful Rite applies.*

*Resist Pain is a prerequisite for Ignore Pain.*

*The counter that tracks this skill ONLY refreshes when the user gains
non-zero exp AND there is no other fighting in the room. If the user
flees or the fight ends some other way, he must gain exp or wait 24
ticks before the skill will function properly again.*

*Ignore Pain will not function if the Berserker has better than -750 AC
at hero, or -1250 AC at Lord.*

*This is a [Rite](Rites.md "wikilink"), not a
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink").*
