1 'IMM NOMINATION' NOMINATION  
IMM NOMINATION: Being an Avatar Immortal is an "invitation only" matter.
A promising player is nominated by an Immortal or Angel, based on their
demonstrated knowledge of the game, maturity, and other skills that may
be observed by long-term exposure to that player. Some of those
nominated players may be invited to become Acolytes, depending on
Avatar's needs.  
One may NOT apply to become an Acolyte. Players may NOT initiate this
process. Do NOT ask an Angel or Immortal to nominate you. This act alone
is grounds for not being chosen.  
Being an Angel or a member of a staff track is entirely separate from
the path to becoming an Immortal. Occasionally an Angel or a track staff
member may become an Immortal, but being an Angel or track staff member
is not a career step between mortal and Immortal. Being an Angel will
neither enhance nor diminish the chance of becoming an Immortal.
