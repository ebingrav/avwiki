*Vaguely reminiscent of an ant, apart from it being 8' tall. This cho-ja
exhibits a huge lower rear abdomen and broad powerful shoulders. The
abdomen has four three-jointed legs and is surmounted by a smaller upper
thorax, roughly comparable to a man's torso, with two almost human arms.
His flesh is encased in shiny black chitin, and each forearm possesses a
natural ridge that appears as sharp as a sword edge. The face is oval,
with multifaceted eyes like metal, above two slits where a nose should
be. The cho-ja's jaw and mouth are surprisingly human in appearance, and
emits a variety of agitated clicks and whistles.*
