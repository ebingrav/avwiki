*You can feed off the weak if you are willing to walk the path of power.
Find a victim who trembles before you and simply sacrifice his body and
soul for your own personal strength. By harnessing that tortured soul
through the immolation, you can use it to boost the strength of your
damage spells for a period of time. The spirit doesn't mind... much. A
little afterlife pain is an enlightening experience for them.*

Prerequisite(s): [Demonic Intent](Demonic_Intent "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'immolation'
\<[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink")\>.

Max level for a mob you can immolate is 1/2 casters level rounded up, so
26 for heroes as all heroes are considered level 51. The higher the
level of mob immolated, the longer the affect will last on the caster.
If failed the mob will attack the caster. Despite this, if the
immolation succeeds spell affects such as invisible, which would
normally be removed by an attack, remain intact.

Further more, if a mob casts Immolation on a player (such as Queen Z in
the [Bodice](Bodice "wikilink") run) a corpse will be created, the
players affects will be cleared, and they will be sent to Floating Above
Thorngate but they will not suffer xp loss from death. As far as I know,
there are no mobs capable of doing this on Midgaard.
