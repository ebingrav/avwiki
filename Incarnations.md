*On your [score](Score.md "wikilink") sheet you may have noticed an
"incarnation" statistic. This number, which for most players is 1,
increases every time a player undergoes the
[remort](Remort.md "wikilink") process and becomes a new
[race](:Category:_Remort_Races.md "wikilink") or
[class](:Category:_Remort_Classes.md "wikilink").*

*Much like the vanity popular among some [Humans](Humans.md "wikilink")
of appending a numeral to their surname to indicate that they are among
the elite who have maintained a name through several generations, the
incarnation statistic is largely ornamental.*

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may view their
incarnation tally using their [score](Score.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink").
