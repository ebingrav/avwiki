*On your [score](Score "wikilink") sheet you may have noticed an
"incarnation" statistic. This number, which for most players is 1,
increases every time a player undergoes the [remort](Remort "wikilink")
process and becomes a new [race](:Category:_Remort_Races "wikilink") or
[class](:Category:_Remort_Classes "wikilink").*

*Much like the vanity popular among some [Humans](Humans "wikilink") of
appending a numeral to their surname to indicate that they are among the
elite who have maintained a name through several generations, the
incarnation statistic is largely ornamental.*

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may view their
incarnation tally using their [score](Score "wikilink")
