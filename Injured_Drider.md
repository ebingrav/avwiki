*This female drider uses her upper body to propel herself along the path
without falling. Already she has lost one leg, back somewhere near the
stairs, but she pressed on for the greater glory of Lloth, worried that
if she failed the entirety of her company might fail. It is not that she
wishes to see the spider-goddess back to her full power, exactly, rather
that she has heard of the cruelty of Veyah and decided that goddess
posed the greater threat to her survival down the road.*
