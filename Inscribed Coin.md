*As you look at the coin you notice how beautifully made the incision
is. It depicts a pick and hammer with a crown above... the royal symbol
of Domi. The coin is no bigger than a marble, yet the engravement is so
detailed you cannot get your eyes off it. You wonder if the coin is just
decorative or has a use.*
