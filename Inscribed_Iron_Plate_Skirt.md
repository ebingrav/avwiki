*A heavy pile of red cloth and long iron plates lay here.*

*This ankle-length skirt is awash in flowing pleats, and ends in a
jagged hem that evokes the lick of flames. Iron plates hanging from the

giant surrounded by an aura of fire. Perhaps the figures represent each
of the major kingdoms of Midgaardia. So are the inscriptions just
wishful thinking, or a practical "to-do" list?*
