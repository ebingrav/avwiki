*Insure add will add an [object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") to the
list of insured [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"). Note that
insuring a quest [item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")
([item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") with the keyword "quest") will
cause it to be bound to you.*

*Insure list with no arguments will list all your insured
[objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") and the unique serial numbers
associated with them. It's a good idea to keep a personal list of these
serial numbers in case the [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") should
be lost; in the event you lose gear during a
[HOG](Hogathons "wikilink"), only insured
[items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") will be reimbursed, and knowing
their serial numbers can help the process. Typing insure list \<serial
\#\> will display detailed information about your insured
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") with that serial number.*

*Insure cancel remove \<[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")\> from
the list of insured [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink").*

*Insure reimburse will restore a missing
[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") to you provided it no longer
exists in the game.*

*Insure quote tells you the cost to insure the specified
[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"); this fee is currently being
waived to encourage the use of insurance.*
