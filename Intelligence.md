*This [attribute](:Category:_Statistics "wikilink") is as important to a
[mage](:Category:_Mages "wikilink") or
[cleric](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") as [Wisdom](Wisdom "wikilink").
Higher intelligence results in more [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink")
gained per level, and allows all
[classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") to [learn](Practice "wikilink")
[skills and spells](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") with fewer
[practices](Practice_Points "wikilink"). Also, higher intelligence
speeds regeneration of [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink") when healing, and
increases damage from [spells](:Category:Spells "wikilink").*
