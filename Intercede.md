*When an [aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink") enemy goes for a
[Bodyguard](:Category:_Bodyguards.md "wikilink")'s master, they'll often
find they never make it. A
[Bodyguard](:Category:_Bodyguards.md "wikilink") with this
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") will automatically leap in
front of any foe he sees about to attack his current monitor target. The
[Bodyguard](:Category:_Bodyguards.md "wikilink") must have
[alertness](Alertness.md "wikilink") active, and must be awake and not
presently fighting to be able to intercede. Foes who start combat with
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink"), or who use special sneaky
attacks can outfox an interceding
[Bodyguard](:Category:_Bodyguards.md "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Watchful Eye](Watchful_Eye.md "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
