An [object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") with this
[flag](:Category:_Object_Flags "wikilink") will disappear when its
[wearer](Wear "wikilink") dies, and therefore can never be looted from
corpses. A well-known example of this is the [Cloak of
Oddities](Cloak_Of_Oddities "wikilink").

Other mobs that possess such items include the [Master of This
Hell](Master_of_This_Hell "wikilink") in [:Category: Greed's
Gallows](:Category:_Greed's_Gallows "wikilink"), who has [the mystic
dragoon's control wand](Mystic_Dragoon's_Control_Wand "wikilink").

This will also appear on items intended for players like the items
dropped in [Zodiac](:Category:Zodiac "wikilink"). However it is a flag
and can be removed with the [cleanse](Cleanse "wikilink") spell.
