EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items). This is
the list of equipment that you're currently using. You will see a blank
next to a wear slot if you have nothing equipped to that slot.

INVENTORY lists your inventory, or equipment not currently being used.

AMMOCHECK allows archers to keep an eye on their ammunition without
having to constantly look at their entire eq list.
