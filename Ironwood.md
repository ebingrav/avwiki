*Twisted in limb and trunk, this ent does not look deformed, but rather
weathered and worked upon by the elements, hardened and made stronger.
The veteran of many battles and skirmishes, he wears his scars as badges
of honour. For the most part now retired from battles, he works to teach
the young entlings how to defend themselves and now takes a place in the
Circle.*

**Description:** *A gnarled ent leans on a cudgel almost as big as
himself.*
