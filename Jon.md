*Lizard hunting can be a profitable source of income, but not one
without danger. Apart from the difficulty in hunting down the lizards
and obtaining their pelts, there is also the danger of falling victim to
one of the many less friendly denizens of the deepways. Jon is a
middling hunter and is known to make a few of his own goods for trade to
select customers.*
