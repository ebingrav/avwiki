*I have sent every other page from this journal out in the hopes of
being saved. I have kept this last page so that if any one does come
there will be a record of the horrible discovery I have made. This room
I am forced to stay in is apparently where the High Drow made sacrifices
to empower their summoning cavern. One of these sacrifices came to me as
a spirit last night and told me the story of [this
place](:Category:_Cavern_Of_ManyJaws "wikilink"). The High Drow created
[the cavern](:Category:_Cavern_Of_ManyJaws "wikilink") to summon some
fell champion from another plane to fight for them in some small
skirmish. The High Drow miscalculated, however and opened a rift to a
different plane. A plane not even they had heard of before. Unnatural
beasts of bone and amorphous flesh poured into our world from this rift.
The High Drow found they were powerless to completely close the rift but
could slow how many were coming through and seal the cavern off. The
greatest of these creatures to come through this rift was a beast the
High Drow called [ManyJaws](ManyJaws "wikilink"). Perhaps the killing of
this beast, the apparent master of the others, would close the rift
forever. To open the door leading to [this foul
abomination](ManyJaws "wikilink") you need [a key
made](Black_Bone_Key "wikilink") from [a drow
jawbone](Jaw_Bone "wikilink").*
