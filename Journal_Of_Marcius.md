*I have sent every other page from this journal out in the hopes of
being saved. I have kept this last page so that if any one does come
there will be a record of the horrible discovery I have made. This room
I am forced to stay in is apparently where the High Drow made sacrifices
to empower their summoning cavern. One of these sacrifices came to me as
a spirit last night and told me the story of [this
place](:Category:_Cavern_Of_ManyJaws.md "wikilink"). The High Drow
created [the cavern](:Category:_Cavern_Of_ManyJaws.md "wikilink") to
summon some fell champion from another plane to fight for them in some
small skirmish. The High Drow miscalculated, however and opened a rift
to a different plane. A plane not even they had heard of before.
Unnatural beasts of bone and amorphous flesh poured into our world from
this rift. The High Drow found they were powerless to completely close
the rift but could slow how many were coming through and seal the cavern
off. The greatest of these creatures to come through this rift was a
beast the High Drow called [ManyJaws](ManyJaws.md "wikilink"). Perhaps
the killing of this beast, the apparent master of the others, would
close the rift forever. To open the door leading to [this foul
abomination](ManyJaws.md "wikilink") you need [a key
made](Black_Bone_Key.md "wikilink") from [a drow
jawbone](Jaw_Bone.md "wikilink").*
