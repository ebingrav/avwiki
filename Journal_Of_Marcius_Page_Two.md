*We arrived in [the ruins of the High Drow
city](:Category:_Ruins_Of_Reveria.md "wikilink") yesterday and
surprisingly had little trouble finding [the cavern for which I was
searching](:Category:_Cavern_Of_ManyJaws.md "wikilink"). We camped for
the night and promptly entered [the
cavern](:Category:_Cavern_Of_ManyJaws.md "wikilink") come morning. I was
highly astonished what I found inside. It appears the High Drow had
built [this cavern](:Category:_Cavern_Of_ManyJaws.md "wikilink") as some
sort of large summoning chamber, greatly increasing the power over more
convential summoning methods. We were even more highly amazed at the
lack of anything occupying this cavern. It was quiet as a tomb as we
wandered through it. I spent the day making etchings of the runes in the
walls and we made camp before the flooded rooms planning to venture
onward with magical help the next day.*
