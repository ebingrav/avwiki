*This is the personal journal of Chalmus' only apprentice, Simon
MacAlvay. It is opened to a certain page, which reads as follows:*  
*It's so frustrating that he doesn't trust me with it. He must
underestimate my abilities. Why else would he keep it from me? In any
event, I shouldn't let his senselessness bother me so much, for in the
long run it matters not. The poor fool's mind is too weak with age to
handle the powers of that [miraculous
stone](Small_Grey_Stone.md "wikilink") he found. It won't take too much
effort on my part to drive him completely over the brink of insanity.
Then I'll be free to experiment with the stone as much as I please.*
