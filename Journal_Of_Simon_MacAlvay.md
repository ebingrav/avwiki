*This is the personal journal of Chalmus' only apprentice, Simon
MacAlvay. It is opened to a certain page, which reads as follows:*  
*It's so frustrating that he doesn't trust me with it. He must
underestimate my abilities. Why else would he keep it from me? In any
event, I shouldn't let his senselessness bother me so much, for in the
long run it matters not. The poor fool's mind is too weak with age to
handle the powers of that [miraculous
stone](Small_Grey_Stone "wikilink") he found. It won't take too much
effort on my part to drive him completely over the brink of insanity.
Then I'll be free to experiment with the stone as much as I please.*
