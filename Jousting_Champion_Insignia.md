One of the very first insignias that can be gained on a fresh adventurer
is that of [winning the Jousting
competition](Jousting_Champion_Quest "wikilink") at the
[Carnival](:Category:Carnival "wikilink"). The insignia will be
customized to the holder - it will have the player's name on it.

While purely cosmetic, unlike [Wayside Kobold Slayer
Insignia](Wayside_Kobold_Slayer_Insignia "wikilink"), it is quite shiny,
and proves the player has the *right stuff*.
