*His face displays an almost chilling calm without a trace of remorse
for his own actions. He clutches [a
dagger](Scarlet-Tainted_Dagger "wikilink") in his hand, etched with
runes and scarlet-tainted to the hilt. This and the deep wound in his
chest attest to the bitter circumstances of his death. Unmoving rivulets
of blood radiate from his heart like a spider fashioned of precious
ruby.*
