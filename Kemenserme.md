*This [high-elf](High_Elves "wikilink") pays you little attention as she
mourns here among these mosses. As you listen a bit to her fervent pleas
to [Roixa](Roixa "wikilink"), you learn that her name is Kemenserme and
that she, her husband Kemenvarno, and their son
[Roccondil](Roccondil "wikilink") were all exiled years ago from the
[Kingdom of the Willows](:Category:_Kingdom_Of_The_Willows "wikilink")
due to a foolish dispute between her husband and his cousin, the [Grand
Guardian](Grand_Guardian "wikilink"). Since then, they have made a new
life both wandering and protecting Midgaardia's forests. They also cared
for an orphaned giant named [Konk](Konk "wikilink") who became their
loyal family [bodyguard](:Category:_Bodyguards "wikilink"). After
hearing rumors that darklin insectoids were threatening
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink"), these four traveled to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") to see how they could help.
Here, they were invited by [ranger Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink")
to aid his sylvan militia, which offer they gladly accepted. Her
husband, Kemenvarno, recently returned from a scouting mission behaving
a bit strangely and then vanished, as did an Odevar warrior shortly
thereafter. She begs [Roixa](Roixa "wikilink") for their safe return, or
at least to know what became of them. This appears to be a poor time to
speak with her.*
