*This [high-elf](High_Elves.md "wikilink") pays you little attention as
she mourns here among these mosses. As you listen a bit to her fervent
pleas to [Roixa](Roixa.md "wikilink"), you learn that her name is
Kemenserme and that she, her husband Kemenvarno, and their son
[Roccondil](Roccondil.md "wikilink") were all exiled years ago from the
[Kingdom of the
Willows](:Category:_Kingdom_Of_The_Willows.md "wikilink") due to a
foolish dispute between her husband and his cousin, the [Grand
Guardian](Grand_Guardian.md "wikilink"). Since then, they have made a
new life both wandering and protecting Midgaardia's forests. They also
cared for an orphaned giant named [Konk](Konk.md "wikilink") who became
their loyal family [bodyguard](:Category:_Bodyguards.md "wikilink").
After hearing rumors that darklin insectoids were threatening
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink"), these four traveled to
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") to see how they could
help. Here, they were invited by [ranger
Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink") to aid his sylvan militia, which
offer they gladly accepted. Her husband, Kemenvarno, recently returned
from a scouting mission behaving a bit strangely and then vanished, as
did an Odevar warrior shortly thereafter. She begs
[Roixa](Roixa.md "wikilink") for their safe return, or at least to know
what became of them. This appears to be a poor time to speak with her.*
