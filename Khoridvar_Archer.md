*A Khoridvar [archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") returns your gaze,
smiles weakly, and introduces herself as a fellow guest. "When
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink") learned that
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s darklin were expanding
their activity northward and threatening the [Odevar
Hills](:Category:_Odevar_Hills "wikilink"), he called upon each of our
tribes to send one of its best fighters to join his militia here. Even
though my clan's home is now under siege by these darklin, and I was
reluctant to leave them in such dire circumstances, [my clan
chief](Khoridvar_Clan_Chief "wikilink") decided to send me and persuaded
me to come. I apologize for my long face but I foolishly challenged two
of these [centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink") here to an archery contest and
it seems that they both got the best of me, but I'll get over it--and
perhaps I'll even beat them both if we have a rematch. I just wish that
I knew what became of one of my fellow
[lizardmen](Lizardmen "wikilink")--the Odevar warrior that [King
Osreva](Osreva,_King_Of_The_Odevar "wikilink") sent. She sure was acting
oddly after that [high-elven](High_Elves "wikilink")
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") disappeared. Last I saw her, she
was busy taking a [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink")
[priest](:Category:_Priests "wikilink") to go see something interesting
in a ferny glen. Anyway, I'd best go collect my
[arrows](Steel_Arrows "wikilink") now and practice some more. Take care,
my friends! Together, I know that we can reclaim
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")--and bring relief to my home
and family by [the hills](:Category:_Odevar_Hills "wikilink")."*
