*Killl'gher is over seven feet tall, with black skin, a large horn on
his head, and spikes all over his arms. His six-fingered claws are razor
sharp and could kill you instantly. His biggest and most fearsome

Killl'gher is guarded by three demons ([Tkachuk](Tkachuk "wikilink")
level 65, [Forsberg](Forsberg "wikilink") level 65, and
[Fleury](Fleury "wikilink") level 63 \[hockey, eh?\]) (note: Tkachuk
sees invis and is aggie. The others are not aggie and will not assist on
heros, at least with sneak and move hidden.)

All 4 demons have [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink").
