\`\`The Kinetic Damroll stat is an extra damage done when you succeed in
hitting a creature with a kinetic damage spell like [weapon
rush](Weapon_Rush "wikilink") or [dancing
weapon](Dancing_Weapon "wikilink"). There are some pieces of equipment
scattered about which will grant you a bonus, and identifying an item
will reveal this.

[Psionicists](:Category:Psionicists "wikilink") that have mastered the
weapon rush skill will also be able to see their current kinetic damroll
in their score (see help score).\`\`
