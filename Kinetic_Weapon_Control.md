*There are a number of factors that can come into play when a psionicist
attempts to retrieve their weapon after performing a [telekinetic
attack](:Category:_Telekinetic_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink").*

*A [psion](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") with a powerful mind can
control the motion of a heavy weapon with ease. Those with nimble
fingers have an easier time catching the weapon once it's close to their
body.*

*Two-handed weapons with long shafts are particularly easy to recoup, as
are those of an immaterial essence. Weapons with multiple attacking
heads can be difficult to catch; and flexible weapons, such as chains,
fly awkwardly through the air.*

*In general, a psionicist who is [specially attuned](Insure "wikilink")
to their weapon will have greater success in attempting to retrieve it.*

## Comments

The last sentence about being "specially attuned" to your weapon is
referring to the Psionicist having insured their weapon. The weapon must
be insured directly, the benefit won't be seen if the wielder is just an
altof whomever has the item insured.
