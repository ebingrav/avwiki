*King Ka'plar is a very large man, with solid black eyes and a bald
head. He wears a band of serpent skin around his head, with an onyx
fastened in the middle. He stares out his window, planning conquest
where he chooses. However, you find yourself about to discover his great
secret. None dare intrude upon his personal chambers. Those who do,
realize the mistake they've made as his eyes flare red, and his body
transforms into a huge, vicious, deadly serpent.*
