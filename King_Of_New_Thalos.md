''Sitting not-entirely-regally in a disintegrating crow's nest, this
half- elf wears a misshapen crown of driftwood and brandishes a scepter
that might have once been a thigh bone. He giggles hysterically as he
shouts to the wretched castaways crawling the drift hulk below him,
though none deign to respond. When he notices you, he scowls and quakes
with anger.

'' "Who dares intrude my throne room unbidden!?" He screams, red faced.
"Kneel before me, subject, or the royal guards will have your head, and
I will personally mount it upon the lighthouses for all to see!"

''Without warning, the half-elf's disposition changes. With madness
still in his eyes, he graciously continues,

'' "Oh, how silly of me. You must be foreign dignitaries, come to pay
your respects as I rule 'in absentia'! But of course, but of course!
Tell me, how fares New Thalos during my exile?"

*Yikes! This fellow must have been shipwrecked here for a LONG time...*
