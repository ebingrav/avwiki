*Amusingly, this nervous [giant](Giants "wikilink") looks as if he would
believe whatever answer you gave him. He appears to be very much at home
in the woods. His clothing seems to be of [elvish](Elves "wikilink")
style, curiously, and from [his
weapon](Konk's_Gigantic_Clobberin'_Stick "wikilink"), you gather that
his name must be Konk. Konk appears to be waiting in this thicket for
something--or for someone other than you--and, judging from all of the
trampled underbrush about him, he has been doing so for some time now.
He looks a bit uncomfortable as his stomach grumbles loudly; he seems to
be terribly hungry.*

## Comments

Konk is [Centaur Hollow](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow "wikilink")'s only
[portable](Portal "wikilink") [mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink").

Because Konk [stands](Sentinel_Mobs "wikilink") in a
"[safe](Safe_Rooms "wikilink")" room,
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") who want [his
stick](Konk's_Gigantic_Clobberin'_Stick "wikilink") may not obtain it by
[killing](Kill "wikilink") him; however, he will give one to those who
complete a simple [ticket quest](:Category:_Ticket_Quests "wikilink").
See [Konk's Gigantic Clobberin' Stick
Quest](Konk's_Gigantic_Clobberin'_Stick_Quest "wikilink") for more
information on this matter.
