*An old bronze dragon, one of the first paladins the realm ever saw,
Koporadrotix served the temple of Tul-Sith for many decades. His battles
saw an end when he faced furry invaders from another plane of existence.
For the last few centuries, he has been protecting the Wall of Beating
Hearts from invaders, looters and other pests. Fortunately, these days
nothing really rises up to the challenge.*
