*At first glance, this creature looks like a [gnome](Gnome "wikilink")
with a wild head of hair and beard that seem to snake out around him.
You then take note of the lower half of his body, which consists of the
legs of a goat. He carries a large stick that almost looks like a club,
and a large leather pouch hangs from his waist. This must be one of the
rare korred, a clan of territorial and chaotic woodland beings. Oh, they
don't take kindly to outsiders, and that describes you.*
