*At first glance, this creature looks like a
[gnome](Gnome.md "wikilink") with a wild head of hair and beard that
seem to snake out around him. You then take note of the lower half of
his body, which consists of the legs of a goat. He carries a large stick
that almost looks like a club, and a large leather pouch hangs from his
waist. This must be one of the rare korred, a clan of territorial and
chaotic woodland beings. Oh, they don't take kindly to outsiders, and
that describes you.*
