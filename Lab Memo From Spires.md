*From: Guardian Priest of the Great Portal Temple*  
*To: Kzinti Scientist \#1273*  
*It is your great honor to have been selected to complete the formula
that*  
*will cure the Great Portal sickness and finally allow our brave
travelers to*  
*return home. When you have completed the formula, tell no one and bring
it*  
*directly to me. Please accept the Kzinti citizen carrying this note as
a*  
*gift from me. He is to be your test subject for the formula. Use him*  
*however you need to and do not worry about his health or welfare. If
he*  
*dies from experimentation I will send you another. Also, per your
request,*  
*I have called in the favor 'they' owe us due to our martial assistance.
My*  
*emissary has traveled there and is going to meet with their leader. He
may*  
*have met with them and is heading back with the ingredients we need.*  
*Sincerely,*  
*The Guardian Priest of the Great Portal*
