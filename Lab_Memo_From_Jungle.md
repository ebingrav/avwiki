*From: Kzinti Science Lab Technician \#1273*  
*To: High Priest and Guardian of the Great Portal Temple*  
*Your Honor,*  
*We have finally completed the formula! These many years of work*  
*have at last paid off. Sadly, my test subject was been driven mad by*  
*the experimentation. That is a small price to pay for a serum that*  
*will cure those courageous adventurers who entered the Great Portal*  
*long ago. I am simply waiting for your emissary to bring the final*  
*ingredients.*  
*Sincerely,*  
*Kzinti Scientist \#1273*
