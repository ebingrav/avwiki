*You can get your items labeled at certain places like [the Ent in
Stonehall](Edmuntrillion "wikilink") for a small fee. This label is
visible to the person carrying the item only ( if they have switched on
label-visibility with config +label ). The label can be changed as often
as you may wish, or even removed.*

*You can label your item with multiple words up to 32 characters long.
It is not possible to label arrows, food, and certain other types of
objects. We're offering a potentially powerful tool to you. Treat it
wisely.*

*WARNING#1: Color labels work... but we suggest you refrain from using
them.*

*WARNING#2: The Immortal Staff can see what you add as a label. Abuse of
current language and in-theme policies will be enforced and can result
in repercussions if ignored. (If there's too much abuse, the command
will no longer be offered to everyone.)*

Syntax: label \<[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")\> \<word(s)\> OR
label \<[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")\> remove
