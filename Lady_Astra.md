*You see before you a woman who was a legend in her own time - Astra -
the*founder of Thorngate, the home of the Lords of Avatar. Legend says
she was *there when the first denizens of the outer planes tried to
invade. She used*up much of her strength repelling the attack and
strengthening Thorngate to ''keep the evil ones at bay.

*Astra smiles at you and says, "Welcome to Thorngate, friend. Did you
know*that many years ago, I cannot recall when, I created Thorngate to
help *protect the realm from the forces of evil? Gilliad still stands
his post*there, focusing upon maintaining the solidity of this Thorngate
against *attacks by other beings, while I have passed out of the mortal
plane of*existence. The Lords of Avatar exist to help with the challenge
of keeping ''Midgaardia safe from the evil of the outer planes.

*"Since I can no longer take an active role in the defence of the realm,
I*have created this place to help young lords learn about the lord tier
and *how to contribute. In here, you will learn just some of the secrets
of the*lord realm. There are rooms dedicated to the basics all lords
should know, ''and also rooms specific for each class.

*"When you are ready, enter the door to the south and take your time to
study*all the rooms."

Flags: Flying  
Room Desc: ''The shade of Lady Astra waits patiently.
