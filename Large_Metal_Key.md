## Comments

This [key](:Category:_Keys.md "wikilink") unlocks the strongbox in
Tul-Sith's Treasure and Vault. Oddly, it also unlocks the door west of
The Vestry of the Temple of Werredan, which is a room on the path from
the first floor of Werredan's Temple to the second floor of Werredan's
Temple.
