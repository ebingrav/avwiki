*The fish's glowing red-eyes pierce through the darkness of the cave in
a menacingly [intelligent](Intelligence.md "wikilink") way. Either the
last flooding of the tunnel has left this monster stranded here, or it
has been living in this water filled pit for a long time. Judging by the
amount of bones on the ground and the way the fish rushes towards you,
probably the latter.*
