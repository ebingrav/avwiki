*Laz is a wanderer by nature, and like all truly powerful wanderers, has
fetched up in Thorngate. He carries many shards of jade on a string
around his neck.*

*He is in search of a little beauty in this dismal place. He notices you
staring, and begins to tell you a tale of a gypsy bard with an enchanted
Faerie lyre that played the most beautiful music, even in the hands of a
human.*

## Comments

This mob appears to be part of a ticket quest for a lyre carried by a
human gypsy.

-   The harp of Ellstraee from Frozen Court does not work.
-   No lyre on gypsies in The Divide or Midgaard Fair as far as I can
    tell.
