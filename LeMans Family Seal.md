Mob: [Beast LeMans](Beast_LeMans "wikilink")  
To obtain the lemans family seal, portal to a
[Cancetaur](Cancetaur "wikilink") or [Ursataur](Ursataur "wikilink")
(aggie but don't detect hidden). This will take you to the [House Of
Beasts](:Category:House_Of_Beasts "wikilink"). Once there, you may track
[Lemans](Beast_LeMans "wikilink") to search him out. He will be upstairs
in an alcove that opens to the south. His private chamber is behind a
closed door to the east, which you have to "pull candelabra" to open.

The cancetaur and ursataur respawn in the two rooms between the two
doors (the visible door and the one with the candelabra) and if you keep
the doors closed, they will stay there. If you open the doors it is
possible that they either walk into the room with LeMans in it and
assist, or walk out into the larger parts of the area. Either way makes
it more difficult to get to the seal so try to keep the doors closed as
much as possible.
