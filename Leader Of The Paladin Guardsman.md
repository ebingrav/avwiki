*The leader of the guards of [Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith "wikilink") is a
[firedrake](Firedrakes "wikilink"). She's served her
[Goddess](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses "wikilink") for many a moon and
in many exotic places. Now she's settled in to guarding the temple. It
is difficult to tell how old a [firedrake](Firedrakes "wikilink") is,
but this one's scars show that she's not inexperienced at what she does.
She casually leans against the wall as she stands guard outside the
offices of the High Priestess.*
