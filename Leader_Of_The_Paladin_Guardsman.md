*The leader of the guards of [Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith.md "wikilink") is a
[firedrake](Firedrakes.md "wikilink"). She's served her
[Goddess](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses.md "wikilink") for many a moon
and in many exotic places. Now she's settled in to guarding the temple.
It is difficult to tell how old a [firedrake](Firedrakes.md "wikilink")
is, but this one's scars show that she's not inexperienced at what she
does. She casually leans against the wall as she stands guard outside
the offices of the High Priestess.*
