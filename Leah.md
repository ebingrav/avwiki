*Clad in a simple dress of forest greens, the small
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers.md "wikilink") seems at ease. At first
glance, Leah appears [human](Humans.md "wikilink"), but a short stature
and plump cheeks suggest a [halfling](Halflings.md "wikilink") ancestor
somewhere on the family tree. "Welcome to my valley. I get so few
visitors these days since I hid the entrance, but it was the only way to
protect the unicorns from danger. The herd is so small these days, and
it will be a long while till they recover from the attacks of
[Verdissis](Verdissis.md "wikilink") and [Pyris](Pyris.md "wikilink").
Bring me proof that these vile beasts will no longer threaten my
unicorns, and I shall reward you." "I have also called for help from
other [rangers](:Category:_Rangers.md "wikilink") to fight the darklin
menace. Too few have responded, so help them if you can, and they may be
of help to you."*
