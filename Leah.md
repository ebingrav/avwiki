*Clad in a simple dress of forest greens, the small
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") seems at ease. At first glance,
Leah appears [human](Humans "wikilink"), but a short stature and plump
cheeks suggest a [halfling](Halflings "wikilink") ancestor somewhere on
the family tree. "Welcome to my valley. I get so few visitors these days
since I hid the entrance, but it was the only way to protect the
unicorns from danger. The herd is so small these days, and it will be a
long while till they recover from the attacks of
[Verdissis](Verdissis "wikilink") and [Pyris](Pyris "wikilink"). Bring
me proof that these vile beasts will no longer threaten my unicorns, and
I shall reward you." "I have also called for help from other
[rangers](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") to fight the darklin menace.
Too few have responded, so help them if you can, and they may be of help
to you."*
