*With ever breath of time that slips between the shattered glass shards,
the power of the potion decreases. The longer one waits, the less of an
affect it will have on the user. Already, the potion is less than half

magical effect; sometimes, when held to the light, it just looks like a
pile of dust collected from a forest floor.*
