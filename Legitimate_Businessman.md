*A short fellow behind a counter keeps watch over his empty storefront.*

*The shopkeeper stops whatever he was in the middle of before you
stepped foot in his store. He silently watches your every move for a
while, then finally says, "There's nothing for you to see here. Now
scram!" Turning his attention to his companion he mutters, "You know if
I were paid for every dimwit to lollygag in my store, I'd be in a much
better mood. Do you see what I have to put up with?"*
