Visit Vincent and he will explain he needs three shards.

Get the first shot on the Astral Dragon who has the first shard and
Inferno stone, then Lord Imix who has the Sceptre of Blazing Fury and
second shard, and finally man-boy Nibnobe who has the lodestone and
third shard. Keep in mind that Sceptre and Lode are reset/reboot only.

You do need to get the first shot in to get the shards to spawn. Don't
be afraid of dying since you're about to evolve anyways!

Shard 1: Inferno stone run

Shard 2: Sceptre of blazing fury run

Shard 3: Lodestone run

Visit [Gilliad](Gilliad "wikilink") and hand him the shards in order as
he asks for them. He will give you the Orb of Flames (a key type item
that you can't save with); bring this back to Vincent and he will unlock
your next evolution.
