*This letter is written on very high quality parchment.*

*[Higgins](Butler_Higgins "wikilink"), my longtime assistant and
faithful friend,*

*Why do so many who are close to me turn against me? My kind gorilla
[Harvey](Harvey_The_Gorilla "wikilink"), my brilliant student
[MacAlvay](Simon_MacAlvay "wikilink"), and even my trusty sword, the
[Trumpeter Fox](Trumpeter_Fox "wikilink"). Words cannot express how much
I appreciate your continued loyalty. I can no longer deny that I am
succumbing to madness, and I am very grateful for all of your help and
support. If you were ever my friend, please do me one request. I will
undoubtedly forget that I ever asked you to do this, and plead with you
to help me undo it. You must take that [accursed
stone](Small_Grey_Stone "wikilink") from my lab and hide it in a place
where I'll never go. Whatever you do, do not tell
[MacAlvay](Simon_MacAlvay "wikilink") what you've done with it, even if
he threatens both you and I.*

*Your trusted friend,*  
*[Chalmus](Chalmus_The_Alchemist "wikilink")*
