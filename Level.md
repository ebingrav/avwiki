<em> Your character advances in power by gaining experience. Humans need
1000 experience points for each level of experience. Other races need
some percentage of 1000 exp for each level, from 666 to 20000 exp
points.

You gain experience by:

  
killing a mob

being part of a group that kills a mob

healing other players (under certain circumstances, as a Priest)

You lose experience by:

  
fleeing from combat

recalling out of combat

being the target of certain spells

dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
how many of this monster have been killed lately; and some random
variation. </em>
