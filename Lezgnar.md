*Lezgnar stands tall at thirteen feet, quite large even for a troll. His
arms and torso are ripped with muscles and he appears to have no neck.
His huge hands end in great claws. A huge tattoo of a broadsword covers
his chest. Around his waist hangs a belt adorned with teeth, seemingly
from each and every race you have ever heard of. The large fangs of a
dragon, the sharp teeth of the kzinti and even the molars of centaurs.
They are all there... He served long as Tannah's lieutenant but now he
resides here, rewarded for his part in the sacking of Ofcol. He notices
you..cracks his knuckles..uhoh...Here comes the pain!*
