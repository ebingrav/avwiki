*Shorter than most grown Lhadvar, the tribe's chief fisherman's great
great grandfather was once a chief hunter. After the tribe anchored on
[the Crystal River](:Category:_Rivers_Of_Avatar "wikilink"), his family
had to learn new skills. But like most of his people, they adapted.
Unlike most Lhadvar, he wears no jewelry to augment his orange brown
scales. The piercing he received during his manhood ceremony was lost
years ago and never replaced. He bears a small tattoo on his forearm in
the shape of a stylized fish surrounded by a simple interlace. It was
the symbol of position. It has started to fade now as he has grown older
and has no son to inherit his position.*
