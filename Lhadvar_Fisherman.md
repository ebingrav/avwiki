*Shorter than most grown Lhadvar, the tribe's chief fisherman's great
great grandfather was once a chief hunter. After the tribe anchored on
[the Crystal River](:Category:_Rivers_Of_Avatar.md "wikilink"), his
family had to learn new skills. But like most of his people, they
adapted. Unlike most Lhadvar, he wears no jewelry to augment his orange
brown scales. The piercing he received during his manhood ceremony was
lost years ago and never replaced. He bears a small tattoo on his
forearm in the shape of a stylized fish surrounded by a simple
interlace. It was the symbol of position. It has started to fade now as
he has grown older and has no son to inherit his position.*
