*Tall, middle aged, strong, the Shaman of the Lhadvar stands amidst the
standing stones. He is watching everything that happens around him. He
looks like he is waiting for someone or something with worry in his eyes
as he scans his surroundings. "Oh, wonderful, strangers be welcome...
Maybe you can help me. My people need more fish and I came here to make
powerful magic to increase the fish population. I worked for days to
find the perfect talisman for my magic. You see, the god of the river
has a liking for gold and since I am calling the fish here... But wait,
you do not need to hear my sad story. "What brings you here to his
isolated location?" He looks at everything with concern in his eyes...
and waits.*
