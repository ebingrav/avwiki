*A Lhadvar [warrior](:Category:_Warriors "wikilink") looks up groggily
and beams warmly at you. "Greetings there, friend," he says, "and may
[Werredan](Werredan "wikilink") smile upon you. It seems that we've been
amassing quite an army here. My people on the [Crystal
River](:Category:_Rivers_Of_Avatar "wikilink") have not yet seen these
darklin nor what awful devastation they are causing wherever they go. I
pray that we shall succeed in this endeavor so that they never will.
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink") called upon my tribe to send one
of their best fighters to help him here and so [my clan's
chief](Lhadvar_Fisherman "wikilink") chose to send me, such as I am. It
would appear that both our Khoridvar cousins and [King
Osreva](Osreva,_King_Of_The_Odevar "wikilink") sent fighters, as well,
though [Osreva](Osreva,_King_Of_The_Odevar "wikilink")'s has now
vanished, as did a [high-elven](High_Elves "wikilink")
[ranger](:Category:_Rangers "wikilink") not long before him. Be careful
about wandering off anywhere on your own--we'll need every combatant
that we can get for this fight and it would be awful to lose any more.
Well, anyway, I've had a strenuous time practicing my spearfighting and
need to rest here a bit longer to regain my vigor. It was very nice to
meet you! If we both survive this, I hope that you can come visit [my
home on the river](:Category:_River_Folk "wikilink"), as well,
someday."*
