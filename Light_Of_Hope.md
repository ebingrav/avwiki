Light of hope is a form of prayer to your God to be used in dire
situations. When cast, your God will heed your prayer and bestow
additional mana based on how needy your comrades are.

If there are badly wounded and physically needy groupmates, your God
will recognize this in the form of additional mana.

Light of hope is exhausted for a short time when cast.
