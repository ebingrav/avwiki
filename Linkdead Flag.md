*To be linkdead is to lose your telnet connection or modem connection
before you [quit](Quit "wikilink") properly. While linkdead you will not
heal
[hp](Hit_Points "wikilink")/[mana](Mana_Points "wikilink")/[movement](Move_Points "wikilink")
at all. However, you will be affected by
[spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") normally, be attacked by
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") as usual, etc. See
[flee](Flee "wikilink") for linkdeath affects during combat. Be very
careful about being involved in combat or in a group if you think you
will lose your link. And, please don't harass linkdead
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink"). If you are worried about
a linkdead [character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink"), ask an
[immortal](:Category:_Immortals "wikilink") to disconnect the person.
Also keep in mind that it is illegal to deliberately make a
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") linkdead to bring on
another and spell it up, [give](Give "wikilink") it
[gold](Gold_In_Hand "wikilink") or
[equipment](:Category:_Gear "wikilink"). This is a form of multiplaying,
which is not allowed on Avatar.*
