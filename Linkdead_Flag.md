*To be linkdead is to lose your telnet connection or modem connection
before you [quit](Quit.md "wikilink") properly. While linkdead you will
not heal
[hp](Hit_Points.md "wikilink")/[mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink")/[movement](Move_Points.md "wikilink")
at all. However, you will be affected by
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") normally, be attacked by
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") as usual, etc. See
[flee](Flee.md "wikilink") for linkdeath affects during combat. Be very
careful about being involved in combat or in a group if you think you
will lose your link. And, please don't harass linkdead
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"). If you are worried
about a linkdead [character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"), ask
an [immortal](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink") to disconnect the
person. Also keep in mind that it is illegal to deliberately make a
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") linkdead to bring on
another and spell it up, [give](Give.md "wikilink") it
[gold](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink") or
[equipment](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink"). This is a form of
multiplaying, which is not allowed on Avatar.*
