Lloydable Rooms are special rooms scattered around the plane in which
lords are capable of using the skills Safe Haven, Planar Anchor, Create
Shrine or Pure/Holy Spring. These are commonly used as alternate
shifting points in many locations to bypass otherwise dangerous shifts,
allowing further groupies to join or otherwise save time.
