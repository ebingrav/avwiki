Some AVATAR MUD [doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") are lockable.
Such [doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") are usually closed and
locked each time that their [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") is
"reset". Players may move beyond closed locked
[doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") by using at least one of four
techniques, which are as follows:

1\) Players who [find](Keyfinder.md "wikilink"), obtain, and carry a
closed locked [door](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink")'s associated
[key](:Category:_Keys.md "wikilink") may [unlock](Unlock.md "wikilink")
it and then [open](Open.md "wikilink") it. This technique will not work
for [doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") that have no associated
[key](:Category:_Keys.md "wikilink").

2\) Players who know how to [pick locks](Pick_Lock.md "wikilink") may
[pick](Pick_(command).md "wikilink") a closed locked
[door](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink")'s lock and then
[open](Open.md "wikilink") it. This technique will not work for
[doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") that are
[pickproof](Pickproof_Doors.md "wikilink").

3\) Players who know how to [bash doors](Bashdoor.md "wikilink") may
bash a closed locked [door](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") open. This
technique will not work for [doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") that
are [bashproof](Bashproof_Doors.md "wikilink").

4\) Players who can magically [pass doors](Pass_Door.md "wikilink") may
move through closed locked [doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink")
without interacting with them. This technique will not work for
[doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") that are
[passproof](Passproof_Doors.md "wikilink").
