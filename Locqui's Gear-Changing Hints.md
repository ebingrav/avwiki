There are a lot of bag swap aliases out there and they're all good. Up
to the point when your bags start reordering in your inventory. I did
some experimenting today and this is what i found:

If you put one container in another, when you remove it it will reorder
to the top of your inventory, even if you then remove gear. This will
force containers to stack, possibly filling your containers prematurely
and leaving you with 1/2 of a set in your inventory and 1/2 of your set
stacked neatly away. This is really annoying.

The fix is simple: put all your stuff into your junk bag, then remove
all, then get your gear container from your junk bag AFTER removing your
gear. Always leave your junk bag in your inventory so it is in the
bottom. Any other containers should stay in the junk bag while swaps are
made, then retrieved from the junk bag after the gear swap is finished.

Example:

alias removetank put all junkbag: rem all: get tankbag junkbag: put all
tankbag: get junkbag tankbag: get all junkbag: put tankbag gearbag

I hope this helps save you hours of aggrivation
