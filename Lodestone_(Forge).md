## Comments

Carried by [Ferromancer Ignicar](Ferromancer_Ignicar "wikilink"), who
shows up in the room as "A glowing giant cackles as he grasps an orb of
power!" and whose description says in part "in his hands is a
pock-marked sphere of spongy metal, apparently the source of much
amusement, for he cannot help but laugh wickedly. Perhaps fire giant
humor is a creature best left unexplained."

This item is involved in at least one ticket quest, although it's not
clear if this is the only combination of items that works to complete
this ticket quest. How many things could you fit together with a
magnet…?

Combine the lodestone with a [Length Of Red Hot
Chain](Length_Of_Red_Hot_Chain "wikilink") and [Fan of Adamantine
Darts](Fan_of_Adamantine_Darts "wikilink") and you'll get a [Chained
Morningstar](Chained_Morningstar "wikilink"):

` You give lodestone to Artificer Coruscianus.`  
` Artificer Coruscianus takes your length of red hot chain.`  
` Artificer Coruscianus takes your fan of adamantine darts.`  
` The artificer clamps the lodestone to his work station and begins the`  
` delicate--by fire giant standards--work of welding the adamantine shards`  
` to its surface. A stream of fire from his forge affixes the chain.`  
` Artificer Coruscianus gives you chained morningstar!`
