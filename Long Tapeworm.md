*The Tapeworm swerves its head toward you and looks you directly in the
face with its small beady eyes. It has a several nested sets of jagged
teeth dripping with slime, blood and gore. It has an alien look. You
wonder if the worm will let you live... I wouldn't count on it. It looks
like it might be vulnerable in certain links along its neck. You better
draw your sword if you want to live to see tomorrow. The tapeworm
cackles at you with evilness emanating and echoing through out the whole
tunnel pit.*
