*A loophole is a design- or code-level defect that allows unintended
behavior. An example of this could be the old equipment duplication bug
that existed in original Merc. Avatar does NOT permit the use of
loopholes, and considers this to be cheating. A list of known loopholes
appears below. This is the list of loopholes we know about and intend to
fix, and which are "illegal" to use. Also, if you happen to know of a
loophole that isn't on this list, we'd appreciate hearing about it..
this makes the gods happy!*

## Known loopholes (illegal)

    spells that require non-combat position (i.e. sanctuary) or gaining
    extra attacks by murder.
