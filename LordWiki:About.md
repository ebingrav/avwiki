Here we are Lords. This is it. Waite and I have big plans for this site.
The Lord game is generally a lot more dynamic than the hero game, with
areas changing, new areas going in and all sorts of wonderful things
happening all of the time. We're really counting on the entire lord
community to get together with this and keep this site as up to date as
possible.

Hopefully one day we'll get to the point that when a new area goes in,
there are people taking notes live on the wiki.

Our reasons for making this Lord Wiki is identical to our
[Motivation](Motivation "wikilink") behind developing the main [Avatar
Wiki]([Main_Page.md "wikilink").

If you want to be a super helpful wiki person who never makes mistakes,
follow our [Format](Format "wikilink") and read our document on
[Contributing](Contributing "wikilink"). More than anything though, feel
free to contribute any knowledge that you have about the lord game. If
you can't take the time to make it match the rest of the site perfectly,
that's fine, just do your best. It's much better to contribute some
poorly formatted information than nothing at all.
