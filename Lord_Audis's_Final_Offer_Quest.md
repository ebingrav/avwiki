Begin by walking or poraling to [Captain
Dieme](Captain_Dieme "wikilink"). He carries [a letter of
ultimatum](Letter_Of_Ultimatum.md "wikilink") which reveals the trouble
brewing around Gorn's Anchor. The captain's description indicates that
we are to inform the mayor of Lord Audis' desires. Do so by giving the
letter to [the mayor](Mayor_Of_Gorn's_Anchor.md "wikilink"), who lives
north of the town square. The mayor will storm out of the room, but upon
close examination we will discover that the mayor has revealed a secret
trap door in the floor or his room. Drop into the basement to find an
unlocked chest containing a [diamond](Diamond.md "wikilink"), an
[emerald](Emerald.md "wikilink"), and a
[topaz](Small_Topaz.md "wikilink") worth 69,000 gold.
