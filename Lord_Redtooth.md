*Stringy hair in his eyes and dressed in torn and dirty clothes, Lord
Redtooth does not look like the devil he is supposed to be. You sense a
presence in him or controlling him that is amazingly powerful. His
unearthly speed and strength and the evil light in his eyes speak to
this truth. You barely have time to prepare yourself as he lunges after
you!*
