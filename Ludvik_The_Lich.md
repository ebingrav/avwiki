*Once a powerful mage, Ludvik turned to the necromantic arts to prolong
his life. Now, with the aid of his arts and the rich source of life the
island above provides, he can not only live forever but also spread his
vile craft and influence throughout the world.*

## Gear

He carries 6 dimly glowing essences and 2 bright glowing essences. The
number of dimly glowing essences goes down if you kill sub-bosses to
weaken Ludvik.

The dimly glowing essences give xp bonuses ranging from 500 xp to 10k
xp.

The bright glowing essence gives either +30 hp -5ac or +30 mana +3 hr/dr
insignia (which essence is which can be found out through identify). One
person can only get one insignia. The reward will decay slightly after
each death and will disappear after your third death.

Note: The essences can be turned in by any alt.

## Comments

Casts spells, including blindness on rare occasion. Does not animate or
eat corpses or pull tricks like switching the tank. Can cast cataclysm.
Can oblit-ANNIHILATE the tank each round. Defeat him and Ailantuhus will
reward you. If you leave the fight, he regenerates quickly.

If he is not weakened, he lasts for a LONG TIME. I had 3 casters surging
3-4, quickening 5 and restoring self and he lasted more than a 100
rounds.

After killing all 8 sub-bosses, with 4 casters (sor + psi + wzd + stm)
quicken 5, surge 3-5, he lasted for 18 rounds. The sor cast about 25
surge-5 torments in that time. Ludvik's hitting was not much less, still
ANNIHILATEd regularly.
