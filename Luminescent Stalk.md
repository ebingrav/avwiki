*An eye glares balefully at you from the end of this severed stalk.
Luminescent liquid within the translucent skin provides enough light to
see by.*

## Comments

It's a permanent AC light that incorporates INT leveling gear, and may
alleviate the need for old, pre-DC casters or [Quixoltan
devotees](Devotion "wikilink") to cast [savvy](Savvy "wikilink"),
possibly allowing them to level well even spell-less. If you have the DC
quests and/or do not need additional int equipment, you'd be better off
with the [orb of the shogun](Orb_Of_The_Shogun "wikilink") due to its
save vs spell bonus. The iwei (not "uwei") has new cousins in town.
Updates to wiki are welcome but be careful in your research expedition.
The mobs have picked up some fighting tips. There are multiple different
versions of this depending on which iwei is skinned:

Mammoth iwei skins into a luminescent stalk (+3 int)  
Gargantuan iwei skins into a luminous stalk (+3 con)  
Hulking iwei skins into a lustrous stalk (+3 wis)
