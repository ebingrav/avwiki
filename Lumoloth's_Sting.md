*Supernaturally sharp and quivering in your grasp, this giant stinger
once belonged to the vengeful goddess Lumoloth. The piercing, venom
tipped blade inspires thoughts of revenge and retribution in all who
wield it.*

## Comments

[Lumoloth](Lumoloth "wikilink") is a large boss mob, and requires
spawning - to do so one needs to kill about 50 mobs that relate to
Lumoloth (if a mob's death does not yield a colored message, it's a
Lumoloth-related mob), self-spelling if required, and without leaving
the area. The process can take several spellups, and makes the weapon
extremely difficult to fodder. Getting a good max damage (49 or 50)
requires luck.

While significantly harder to obtain than the
[Dragon-Blade](Dragon-Blade "wikilink"), classes lacking the sneak
skill, or players who dislike the skill's short duration, might find the
weapon useful. In addition, it is twice the weight, which is better for
the skill [smash](smash "wikilink").
