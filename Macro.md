'' From the Greek word for 'large', a MACRO is a spell that combines the
effects of several smaller spells into one powerful blast of energy. In
casting a macro, one sacrifices a little extra mana for the convenience
of reduced lag and shorter lists of spells to cast.

'' Examples of such macromagical concoctions include the clerics'
awesome AWEN, the psionicists' formidable FORTITUDES, and the magic
users' favorite, FOCI.
