*This half-orc is well equipped for adventure, at least physically. She
wears a smart tunic together with a sturdy leather belt. For protection
she wields a longsword and holds a shield, which shows her loyalty to
the half-orc armies, in her offhand. The only problem is that these
caves have sent her completely insane!*
