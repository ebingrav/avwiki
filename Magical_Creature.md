*This creature is a magical incarnation of the high masters. It has been
waiting for a long time to eat, half-starved. The bones of an unlucky
goblin lie at its feet, picked clean days ago. Apparently the goblin was
scared and tried to flee... but there was no where for him to go,
because he was too occupied to be able to reach the portal before he was
eaten.*
