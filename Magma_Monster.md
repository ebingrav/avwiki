*Created out of magma, this being knows no feelings, no pain, nothing.
It doesn't really think. It just does. And what it does best is destroy.

flowing, hot magma, and could be quite a threat with its large three
fingered paws. Two burning red eyes stare at you maliciously, and a
gaping toothless maw screams something intelligible.*
