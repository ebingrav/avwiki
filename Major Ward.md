Prerequisites:
[Ward](http://avatar.melanarchy.info/index.php?title=Ward)

This is the mysterious fifth ward that a mage can attempt. The most
powerful of wards, it protects an object from every type of spell damage
instead of focusing upon lightning or fire. It also is less stable upon
casting and if not done precisely correct, will fail.

\[NOTE: Major Ward raises item 2 levels and may fail causing
destruction. It will raise the item 5 levels if cast gear of a lower
quality than Lord equipment.\] \[NOTE: Containers destroyed through a
miscast also destroy contents.\]
