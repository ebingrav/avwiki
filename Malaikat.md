*Clad in white armor, this creature radiates pureness of both body and
soul. If he had wings on its back you would think he was an angel. A
long spear in his hand, his eyes ever alert, he stands here in the name
of the rulers of the Temple of Utami to prevent all that dwell here from
freeing their master Belag.*

## Comments

This mob is pretty nasty. It's big, it's tough, it casts. And being a
[psi](psi "wikilink"), some of its spells can be annoying. If you flee
down (it casts [dread](dread "wikilink")), the only direction you can
flee, you won't be able to go back up but will have to come back through
all the locked rooms. Same thing if you die here (it also casts
[overconfidence](overconfidence "wikilink")), which can make a solo
[cr](cr "wikilink") challenging since you'll have to get all the keys
naked.
