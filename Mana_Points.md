''Mana is the power for all magic spells. Each spell costs a certain
amount of mana; for most spells, this cost goes down as the player
increases in [level](Level.md "wikilink"). Also, the player gains more
mana per [level](Level.md "wikilink") if
[intelligence](Intelligence.md "wikilink") is high.
