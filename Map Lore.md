*A keen awareness of one's environment allows some to derive more than
the usual benefits from reading maps. After one hones the
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") of map lore, subtle distinctions
in [terrain](:Category:_Terrains "wikilink") suddenly show their true
value, and and it becomes possible to see whenever one crosses a border
between [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"). An added benefit of the
increased attention to detail this [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink")
imparts is the ability to read [markings](Markings "wikilink") left in a
room with the [woodcraft](Woodcraft "wikilink")
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink"); however, knowledge of map lore
alone won't help one seek out those [marks](Markings "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Lore](Lore "wikilink").
