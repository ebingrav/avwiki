*A keen awareness of one's environment allows some to derive more than
the usual benefits from reading maps. After one hones the
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") of map lore, subtle
distinctions in [terrain](:Category:_Terrains.md "wikilink") suddenly
show their true value, and and it becomes possible to see whenever one
crosses a border between [areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"). An
added benefit of the increased attention to detail this
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") imparts is the ability to read
[markings](Markings.md "wikilink") left in a room with the
[woodcraft](Woodcraft.md "wikilink")
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink"); however, knowledge of map lore
alone won't help one seek out those [marks](Markings.md "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Lore](Lore.md "wikilink").
