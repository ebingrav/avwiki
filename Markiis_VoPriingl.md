*This aging banriith, a member of the Riithi noble caste, is glad to be
on this expedition. The tiresome rituals and formalities of Riithi
civilization have begun to wear upon him, and he leapt at the
opportunity this trip with his nephew offered him. Even if it only
involves the gathering of survey data and relics from the ruins of part
of the ancient High Drow city. Slighter of build than members of the
other castes, he has some clearly elven features, though his
orcish/ogrish ancestry is apparent. Dressed in the plain robes and soft
soled boots of a scholar, he is making one last inspection of the record
tablets listing the items the group has already sent back to the Riithi
city, deeper in the bowels of the earth.*

## Comments

This mob is especially problematic to kill, because he is in a room with
three other highly armored, powerful mobs. If you are hero level,
consider going [Invis](Invis "wikilink") (they can't see due to the
level difference), and [Charm
Person](Charm_Person "wikilink")/[Domination](Domination "wikilink") the
mob you want to kill. Then either pull them into the adjacent room, or
order them to kill themselves by telling them to toss or trip
themselves. If the mob fails toss/trip, the mob will begin killing
itself.
