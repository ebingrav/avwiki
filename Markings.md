[Objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") of this
[type](:Category:_Object_Types.md "wikilink") are practically always
permanent fixtures of [areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") that
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may not [pick
up](Get.md "wikilink"). Markings are most commonly used as signposts
and/or to [open](Open.md "wikilink")
[doors](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink"), sometimes only for
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") of one specific
[class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink").

All markings have four
[type](:Category:_Object_Types.md "wikilink")-specific
[values](:Category:_Object_Values.md "wikilink"): one specifies how
high-[level](Level.md "wikilink") a
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") must be to see it,
another specifies other restrictions on its visibility (like only those
who have [practiced](Practice.md "wikilink") [rogue
lore](Rogue_Lore.md "wikilink") or only those who are
[affected](Affects.md "wikilink") by [detect
hidden](Detect_Hidden.md "wikilink") may see it), another specifies
which [door](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") in its
[room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") (if any) it affects when it is
[pushed](Push.md "wikilink") or [pulled](Pull.md "wikilink"), and yet
another specifies exactly how this
[door](:Category:_Doors.md "wikilink") will be affected by such usage
(like being [opened](Open.md "wikilink") or being
[locked](Lock.md "wikilink")).

One good example of markings are
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink")'s "thief marks," which
serve to help [rogues](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") to find [their
guildmaster](Guildmaster_(rogue).md "wikilink").
