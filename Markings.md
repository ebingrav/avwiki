[Objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") of this
[type](:Category:_Object_Types "wikilink") are practically always
permanent fixtures of [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") that
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may not [pick
up](Get "wikilink"). Markings are most commonly used as signposts and/or
to [open](Open "wikilink") [doors](:Category:_Doors "wikilink"),
sometimes only for [characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") of one
specific [class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink").

All markings have four
[type](:Category:_Object_Types "wikilink")-specific
[values](:Category:_Object_Values "wikilink"): one specifies how
high-[level](Level "wikilink") a
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") must be to see it, another
specifies other restrictions on its visibility (like only those who have
[practiced](Practice "wikilink") [rogue lore](Rogue_Lore "wikilink") or
only those who are [affected](Affects "wikilink") by [detect
hidden](Detect_Hidden "wikilink") may see it), another specifies which
[door](:Category:_Doors "wikilink") in its
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") (if any) it affects when it is
[pushed](Push "wikilink") or [pulled](Pull "wikilink"), and yet another
specifies exactly how this [door](:Category:_Doors "wikilink") will be
affected by such usage (like being [opened](Open "wikilink") or being
[locked](Lock "wikilink")).

One good example of markings are
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard "wikilink")'s "thief marks," which serve
to help [rogues](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") to find [their
guildmaster](Guildmaster_(rogue) "wikilink").
