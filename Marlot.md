*An aging [dwarf](Dwarves "wikilink") with a broad smile and two missing
fingers on his left hand looks up from his reading and says, "Welcome
friend, have you wandered back here by mistake or have you come to see
me?" Realising you have noticed his missing digits he exclaims,
"Darndest thing, one minute I was working the east face, next I wakes up
in the infirmary less two fingers. Blessin' in disguise, couldn't hold
the pick, opened this place. Never regretted it."*
