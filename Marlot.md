*An aging [dwarf](Dwarves.md "wikilink") with a broad smile and two
missing fingers on his left hand looks up from his reading and says,
"Welcome friend, have you wandered back here by mistake or have you come
to see me?" Realising you have noticed his missing digits he exclaims,
"Darndest thing, one minute I was working the east face, next I wakes up
in the infirmary less two fingers. Blessin' in disguise, couldn't hold
the pick, opened this place. Never regretted it."*
