*The pursuit of wealth can change a person, or so it is said, and the
man before you is the person the saying is referring to. Once he was an
enterprising young man, whose ventures made him the most successful
moneychanger in all Midgaardia. Unfortunately his success came as the
result of a deal with MOBA. His banking venture failed when he couldn't
meet MOBA's repayments, leaving him destitute. However, his close
connections with some shady Solace town officials enabled him a
reprieve, and he hatched a new scheme to run an orphanage posing as a
priest. Quickly dissatisfied and driven by greed, he forces the orphans
to steal to line his pockets. He dreams of nothing more than repaying
MOBA and re-opening his banking business in Solace.*

## Comments

In the past, [Solace](:Category:Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink") had a
moneychanger that acted as a bank. Later on, the moneychanger was
replaced with Kir'tal in [Stonehall](:Category:Stonehall.md "wikilink").
This mob is an explanation of where that moneychanger went, at least in
story-line terms.
