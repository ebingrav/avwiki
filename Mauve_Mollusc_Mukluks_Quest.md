This quest is highly difficult for a solo hero, but it's fairly
manageable for a normal hero group with a large tank and at least one
beefy hitter. A pair of casters can complete this as well.

Once at Eragora proper:

-   Portal to [clam girl](Clam-Digger "wikilink"), move 2n, w (aggie).
-   Go d, kill [Deacon](Deacon_(Halfling's_Paradise) "wikilink"), loot
    the fishing rod.

Killing Deacon is the hardest part of the quest, be extra careful. If
you die here, you will be Auto-CR-ed though, which is not the case for
any other room in the area.

The Deacon is a priest, capable of instantly healing from almost dead to
full or some scratches (at random, depends on your luck). He keeps
company with two mobs: A [Bloodthirsty
Idealist](Bloodthirsty_Idealist "wikilink") (bodyguard and bci specs)
and [True Believer](True_Believer "wikilink") (psi - can decept and
death field, but doesn't det). Best advice to defeating them is to flash
the room if possible, target Deacon and surge high. Note that the
idealist will intercede your opening hit on Deacon and can even
intercede area spells! (the psi can be one shotted by a surge 5 disint,
I recommend entering, flashing, surge 5, kill believer (1-2 disints),
kill bloodthirsty(2-3 disints), then kill deacon). Bloodthirsty Idealist
can vital shot your eyes for several tics. Make sure you can cure blind.
(Nefas likes flashing (twice), surge 4 torment bloodthirsty till dead,
surge 5 deacon till dead, calm and exit. Sor can't cure blind, make sure
you have a cure blind quaff in your inventory, or you may be stuck in
the room for repop! Protection of kings is quite helpful in this room
for lords)

-   Portal to [old fish](Halfling_fisherman "wikilink").

If the fisherman is sleeping, you're out of luck. You need to come here
while it is in-game day, AND good weather (the sky should be better than
'snowy' - i.e. at least cloudy). Thus, use *time* and *weather*
commands, and you may try to influence weather via [Control
Weather](Control_Weather "wikilink") spell.

-   Once the fisherman asks for the rod, give it to him, he will fish
    you a nice kraken (tentacles).
-   Kraken will open up with [Cataclysm](Cataclysm "wikilink") spell,
    kill it (much easier than Deacon's room) and skin it for the octopod
    organza.

*Tip*: If you have multiple rods, avoid using any area spells or affects
here since you will kill the fisherman. If he survives, turn the rods in
one by one and skin the krakens as they come.

-   Once you have the organza(s), go 2n, 2e, d, w, n, scan for
    seamstress (*(White Aura) A filthy little girl toils away, mending
    clothes for her family.*, trackable). Be careful, since there are
    various aggies around.
-   Turn in the organza to seamstress for the [Mauve Mollusc
    Mukluks](Mauve_Mollusc_Mukluks "wikilink").
