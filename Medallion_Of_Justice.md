## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"):** [Hall of
Justice](:Category:_Hall_Of_Justice.md "wikilink")
([Map](Hall_Of_Justice_Map.md "wikilink")).  
**[Mob(s)](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink"):** [Zan And
Jayna](Zan_And_Jayna "wikilink").  
First, you need to find the insane man in
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink"). He's
[trackable](Track.md "wikilink").

Kill him for the [scale of justice](Scales_Of_Justice.md "wikilink"),
which you then give to the floating wizard in Hall of Justice - mob is
portable.

Now, continue north till you reach Zan and Jayna, who have the Medallion
of Justice. There is a regen room west of the Green Knight and east of
the Warrior Chieftan.

**NOTE:** This quest is for seriously big heroes - lords can't
participate. Also, if you die along the way a CR can be difficult for
several reasons, among them: this is a solo-only quest and you need to
kill the mobs for the keys to move from room to room. On the plus side I
know the last room at least (with Zan/Jayna) does allow someone to
gurney you to your corpse but is no mercy. If you don't mind dying this
is a neat trick to end up with two people fighting the gear mob, despite
being a solo-only quest.
