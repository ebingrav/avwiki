Is it possible to put external links in the sidebar? Cause a link to the
lord wiki would be well in place on the Tiers section.

Any chance we could put [:Category:Quests](:Category:Quests "wikilink")
into the "misc" section? --[Neyne](User:Neyne.md "wikilink") 13:07, 28

I will second this. also, can we dump Community portal link, and rename
"Current events" to "Event Archive" or maybe "Game History"? Thank you!
