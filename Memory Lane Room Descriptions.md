Now  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
Now is now, and you see what is happening now. All around beats the ebb
and flow of the dreams and realities of the currentude of the pressing
instant's quintessential arcana. As any respected Quantakineticist could
tell you, you have entered a region of the Astral Plane where Dreams go
to die. Here all the momentous events of the past are made real again by
the astral traces of their memories and spirits. Inside you will find
astral representations of foes you could never hope to defeat in life.

Tiamat's Escape from Hell  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
You are in the scrying chamber of Anthraxus, Lord of Tarterus. An
enormous glowing portal fills the room, peering into the first Plane of
Hell, where Tiamat, Queen of Dragons had been imprisoned. This must be a
scene from when Tiamat fled Hell to occupy the Citadel the Demon Lord
had built for her.  
(Flying) (White Aura) A shadow of Anthraxus conjures the spirit of the
Dragon Queen.

You follow Auryn down.  
The Lords of Midgaardia  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The Realm is brightened by the presence of Lord Darksword!

The next step in the Ascension of the Avatar has begun! Heroes have
begun to evolve into Lords. Deep in the recesses of interplanar
darkness, Straul screams a cry of frustration.

You follow Auryn west.  
The Time of Peace  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
With the Giants forgetful of their purpose, a time of relative peace
settles over Midgaardia, baring the occasional Golem or Gith invasion.
The Quest of Ascension continues, as the ranks of Midgaardia's Heroes
grow to even larger than before the 2nd war.

You follow Auryn west.  
The Founding of Midgaard  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
In the clearing left by the demolition of Glasya's temple, the displaced
survivors of Keresh begin the building of a humble village they call
Midgaard. Thus begins the Time of Man, when the Children of Acilese
would assert themselves as the dominant race of Midgaardia.

You follow Auryn north.  
Aftermath  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The Heroes are wiped out and the Quest of Ascension has been set back
hundreds of years. The Ents are all but gone, the Elves and Dwarves have
suffered enormous loses. Slowly, but surely, the forests return to
normal, and the world starts over.

You follow Auryn east.  
The Flipside Altar  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The last of the Heroes die nobly trying to destroy Glasya within his
Temple. The Immortal Guardians lose patience, and step in at last.
Glasya's temple and the surrounding, corrupted forest are buried as the
ground is turned over. The minds of Giants are permanently enfeebled by
the Immortals, and they lose their purpose and forget their dark God.
The 2nd Great War is over.

You follow Auryn up.  
The Second Great War  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
You witness the destruction of Avalon, the last of the Ancient Fae
Palaces, as the Giants and Ents battle over it. Glass pillars 6-foot
thick shatter into shimmering dust, golden walls are beaten down and
trampled into the dirt. The High Elves fire their magical bows at the
Giants, but it is like the buzzing of gnats to the footsoldiers of
Glasya.

You follow Auryn south.  
The Second Great War  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
Keresh is falling down. Giants wade through the once proud marble city
in a battle with the last copse of the Ents. A huge stone pillar falls
and shatters behind you with a deafening roar. The dusty smoke of
destruction chokes your throat and eyes.

You follow Auryn east.  
The Second Great War  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The Troglodyte Queen Igecsoz smiles as the Giant footsoldiers of Glasya
construct a city for her people. Her new alliance has guaranteed the
safety of her people for thousands of years.  
(Translucent) (Flying) (White Aura) The Ancient Trog Queen looks just
like her statue!

You follow Auryn down.  
Glasya  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The works of Kisestre are twisted and warped in a cruel mockery around
the throne of the Demon God Glasya. Plants with tentacles for branches
try to draw you into their gaping maws, dead corpses of elves and humans
are animated by cruel, dark vines wrapped around their limbs. Like
sinister marionettes they prance for the architect of the Second Great
War, for Glasya has roused the Giants.  
(Translucent) (Flying) (White Aura) Glasya sits upon a throne moulded
from a dead tree stump.

You follow Auryn down.  
The Lady Astra  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
Although not part of the Quest for the Avatar, Astra the Half-Elf was
the first of Acilese's Children to obtain the equivalent of Lordly
power, when she developed interplanar magic and vanished suddenly from
her chambers in Keresh. Her discovery of Thorngate and her fateful
meeting with the Legendary Gilliad are another story entirely...

You follow Auryn north.  
Founding of Keresh  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The glory of the old world, Keresh was the first city built by the
children of Acilese. In many ways, it is more impressive than its larger
successor, Midgaard, being made much larger in scale, and theoretically
with more primitive techniques. On one side, you see a large ring of
stone, presumably the footwork of the coliseum that is today known as
Senex Operis.

You follow Auryn west.  
Acilese's lesser folk  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The Lesser Folk, as they were called by the Elves whose lifespans and
arcane powers dwarved theirs, inherited one very important
characteristic from their Mother; They bred like rabbits, and did not
stay with a single mate for life. The result was that the so called
'Lesser Folk' quickly spread across the face of Midgaardia, and would
eventually become the most common race there. Today we call them
"Humans."

You follow Auryn south.  
The War of Giants and Ents  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The Leaders of the Giants kneel in defeat before the Grandmother Ent.
The forest for miles around you have been trampled flat. Trees have been
tossed and battered and chopped as if they had been in the war
themselves. The natural beauty of Midgaardia has been forever marred.

You follow Auryn south.  
The War of Giants and Ents  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
In an effort to disrupt the ascension of the Avatar, Straul wrought
Giant warriors upon Midgaardia to destroy all the natural works of
Kisestre. You are in the middle of a forest of trees so tall you can
scarcely tell if they have leaves at all. A squadron of marauding giants
stalk through the mighty trees, shattering their bark and digging up
their roots as they hunt for the Ents.

You follow Auryn down.  
The Children of Acilese  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The Goddess of Love grows tired of the eternal love of the Dragons and
the Elves. Even the less romantic races of the time, the Lizard Folk and
the Dwarves mated pretty much for life, and Acilese did not consider the
Troglodytes or Trolls capable of love. Thus, in her boredom, she creates
lovers for herself, in her form, but masculine. She is largely shunned
for this by the ancient Gods, who lay a terrible curse upon the
offspring produced with her creations; They are mortal, and have a
lifespan barely a tenth of that of the Elves. They whither and die in
what to the Goddess of Love is but a few days. Thus she left Midgaardia
in tears, never to return.

You follow Auryn east.  
The Departure of the Fae  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The first borne of the 8th generation of Midgaardian Fae is Veyah
L'Aturii, the first of the High Elves who would eventually become Queen
of the Ancient Drow. She has no wings. She is not Immortal. Realizing
that Midgaardia is sapping his people of their Power, Adrial and
Zydarielle put aside their differences and lead the Fae to Arcadia, land
of Dreams, where their splendor will never again be tarnished by the
muck of mortality.

You follow Auryn east.  
The War of Dwarves and Trolls  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
Mt. Durr and Mt. Abishai glare at each other from opposite ends of the
mountain range known as Tiamat's Teeth. Their creations, the Dwarves and
the Trolls wage war on their slopes to prove for all time whom is the
King of the Mountains. Alas, the War would eventually end in a tie with
the death of Kra in the Battle of the Great Divide.

You follow Auryn east.  
The War of Dragons  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The War is at last halted by Quixoltan, and Bahamut and Tiamat and their
closest kin are exiled from Midgaardia. Those that remain either go into
hiding or are transformed into Troglodytes and Lizard Folk, cursed to
never again touch the skies.

You follow Auryn north.  
The War of Dragons  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
Vanity is the Dragon's birthright, and the vanity of the Son and
Daughter of Quixoltan begot a tremendous War of Dragons that raged for
Centuries, as Bahamut and Tiamat and their ilk both tried to claim
Midgaardia as their own.

You follow Auryn down.  
Death  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The Goddess is Dead.

Neglected by her companions and weary of her natural kingdom, loneliness
and anguish have proven the undoing of Kisestre the Young. She lies on a
grassy hill amid a ring of trees, flowers bloom around her, and all the
world hangs still and silent, as if in mourning.  
(Translucent) (Flying) (Demonic) (Black Aura) Death lurks in the
shadows.

You follow Auryn west.  
Quixoltan's Kin  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
A regal and majestic feathered serpent fills the sky, the sun light
filtering through its myriad colored feathers and reflecting off its
scales sending tiny rainbows dancing through the air like fairies. This
is Quixoltan, father-God to Dragons.  
(Translucent) (Flying) (White Aura) The fading image of a beautiful
serpent God preens and poses.

You follow Auryn north.  
The Time of Wonder  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The forest is gorgeous, every tree being utterly different from its
neighbors, their leaves weaving into a dark tapestry above. The light
through the leaves is a dusky red, and seems to hang in the air on its
way to the ground. Moss covers everything, and spider webs shine with
dew among the leaves. Millions of eyes watch you from the shadows.

And yet, this is not Arcadia, this is Midgaardia as it was during the
time of the Fae.  
(Translucent) (White Aura) A young Fae dances in the glade.

You follow Auryn up.  
The Birth of the Fae  
\[Exits: north east south west up down\]  
The God of Wonder sends a gift to his daughter in her hours of
loneliness and despair. A ring of twenty-six beings of pure Magic and
Dreams, thirteen of the light, and thirteen of the twilight. You see
familiar faces and hear their names called by their Creator, Adrial
Skythain, Kipparielle the Magnificent, Manon of the Spring...

The Original Fae spring to life around you in an explosion of color and
light.  
(Translucent) (Demonic) (Black Aura) The Dark Fae Queen's image turns to
you with malice in its eyes.

You follow Auryn up.  
The transformation ( Lloydable )  
\[Exits: up down\]  
Huge roots and vines push past you, burrowing into the cold, sterile
ground and churning it into vibrant, living earth. Mighty branches reach
upward, sprouting leaves and flowers of wonder and magic, clawing down
the icy blanket that chokes the sky. Singing birds spring to life from
the stones.

You witness the birth of all things living at the hand of Kisestre.

You follow Auryn up.  
A barren prison  
\[Exits: up down\]  
You wander alone through fields of emptiness and despair. The sullen
stones and dead earth loom around you like nightmares creeping into your
soul. The sky is devoid of form or color, and the stars and sun and
moon, if they even exist, fail to penetrate the frigid pall that chokes
the air.

Here, magic runs dry. Dreams wither and choke, splayed across the
unforgiving face of the cruel stone. This is the World as it Was. The
Prison of Kisestre.

You follow Auryn up.  
The making of the world ( Anti-Magic )  
\[Exits: No Obvious Exits\]  
"And a jealous Straul wrought a prison for Kisestre, a world of stone
and ash, devoid of beauty, upon which to keep her until she learned to
love him."  
(Translucent) (Demonic) (Black Aura) the Memory of Straul is here,
fighting NightHawk.  
(Translucent) (White Aura) True good can never be caged.  
You give the fae rune for 'Hope' to the Memory of Kisestre.  
Kisestre's images smiles and the room brightens like the sun breaking
between stormclouds.  
"You are not yet powerful enough to defeat even the faintest reflection
of Straul, but there is yet some good you can accomplish here. Seek ye
out Sygerion..."

A chamber of Illusion  
\[Exits: down\]  
The room twists and warps and bends and breaks and shatters and dances
and undulates and wiggles and splinters and waves and fractures.

The Sun Cabal's Illusionist is doing his best to slow you down.  
(White Aura) Ahl Pharazon is here, fighting Verminaard.

You follow Auryn north.  
A Chamber of Death  
\[Exits: down\]  
All around you rises the stink and steam of death and decay. The dying
claw at your legs as they are sucked down into the rotten bog of beyond.

After a few minutes, you can barely even hear the screaming any more.  
(Demonic) (Black Aura) Hrjaa is here, fighting NightHawk.  

You follow Auryn north.  
A Chamber of Prayer  
\[Exits: down\]  
The pale light of Tul-Sith's power fills the room. Although Tul-Sith
herself is a benevolent and kindly Goddess, not all who wield her power
follow that example.

Case in point, Granpater Laur of the Sun Cabal.  
(White Aura) Granpater Laur is here, fighting NightHawk.  

You follow Auryn north.  
Floating in the void  
\[Exits: down\]  
You are nowhere and everywhere, atop the world and sealed hopelessly
within the head of a pin.

Space warps like frosted glass at the behest of the Sun Cabal's
Displacer.  
Tchaize is here, fighting NightHawk.  
Tchaize is here, fighting NightHawk.  
(White Aura) Tchaize is here, fighting NightHawk.  

You follow Auryn north.  
The memory of Bahamut  
\[Exits: north east south west down\]  
Above you, Tiamat and Bahamut, mother and father of Dragons, are frozen,
locked in terrible and brutal battle, ravishing and ruining the ground
below them.

Several smaller Dragons, the size of villages, fly around them like
insects.

Above the horrible tableau, one figure moves toward you.  
(Translucent) (Flying) (White Aura) Bahamut's kin is here, fighting
Verminaard.  
(Translucent) (Flying) (White Aura) Bahamut's kin is here, fighting
Verminaard.  
(Translucent) (Flying) (White Aura) Bahamut's kin is here, fighting
Verminaard.  
(White Aura) Sygerion is here, fighting Verminaard.
