*Looking at this entity does you no good. Your physical senses seem not
to be able to perceive it properly, as if it does not truthfully exist
on the same plane of reality as anything you have encountered before.
Rather, you feel this being in a more visceral manner, images flashing
through your mind.*

*A being of primal power, beauty so terrible and dark that Midgaardia
can no longer bear its touch. Raw intellect bound with elder magic
intoxicates the senses. Worship and fear. Veneration and submission.*

*A hand stretches out and the world changes in response to its will and
whim. Nature is mastered, bound, twisted and corrupted. Laws of reality
are written and rewritten. Creation is flexible.*

*Contention comes and limits are imposed. Boundaries are laid and rules
implaced. A balance is enforced, order to the infinite.*

*War. Fire. Blood. Energy. Pain. Death.*

*Beyond the great barrier, even death can be conquored by those with
sufficient power, but stripped to the core, split into concepts, a
prison arises for that which cannot die.*

*Waiting.*
