This is a second in the chain of Patrol Quests, to start it give your
[Badge Of Solace](Badge_Of_Solace "wikilink") from the [Solace Patrol
Quest](Solace_Patrol_Quest "wikilink") to the mayor of Mervue. You can
find him in the inn 2n, 3w, 2n, w from [Ent
banker](banker.md "wikilink").

Step 1: You are tasked to find some smugglers and bring the mayor the
smuggled loot. Smugglers are on the beach, in the far southeast of the
area.

Step 2: You will receive an arrest warrant, to be served to a shopkeeper
that would usually sell such confiscated loot. This can vary greatly and
changes each time - look at the warrant to see which shopkeeper would
sell such items. The bartender is also a shopkeeper.

Step 3: When the warrant is served correctly, a short cutscene will play
and indicate there are smugglers docked in the harbor.

Step 4: Hunt down the pirate captain (usually on the ship n, w from
[Charon](Charon "wikilink"), if not just find his ship), loot the
captains crest, and return it to the mayor.

You will receive a free level, the [Honorary Justice Guard Of Mervue
Insignia](Honorary_Justice_Guard_Of_Mervue_Insignia "wikilink"), and a
[Badge Of Mervue](Badge_Of_Mervue "wikilink"), used to start the
[Midgaard Patrol Quest](Midgaard_Patrol_Quest "wikilink") at level 34.
