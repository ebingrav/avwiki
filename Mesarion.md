*Mesarion was a red dragon who gained most of his wealth by
systematically raiding trade routes on both sides of the Great Wall. He
kept raiding, year after year until the entire Midgaard's garrison was
rallied to hunt him down. Being mortally wounded and unwilling to let
go, he withdrew to the Dracoleum and passed on his wealth, to now exist
as a [living statue](Golems.md "wikilink").*
