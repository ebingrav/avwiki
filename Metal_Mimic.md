## Comments

Metal Mimic is just what it sounds like - it can and will take on the
characteristics (and identity) of you or a member of your party.
Additionally, it is aggressive. When you are hogged, it also takes on
the hog. If you have a hogged member, have him/her wait (rest) until the
fight has begun and the mimic has chosen someone to copy, then the
hogged group member should be OK to come in and kill.

In summary - very difficult mob to kill.
