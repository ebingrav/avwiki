*Specially trained by the [Lord of the
Hunt](Lord_Of_The_Hunt "wikilink"), the Royal Surveyor keeps an eye on
the survey of this ancient ruin. Giving a grim nod, he speaks quietly,*

*"So you are the adventurers that I requested... Allow me to explain
what I need you to do. There is a serpent in these ruins, that has
already taken the life of several of my men. Our arrows seem to bounce
off its hide, as if it were made of stone. Kill it, and bring its tail
to me. I'll give you further instructions then."*
