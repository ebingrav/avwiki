*As a member of the Riithi noble caste, this banriith has wealth,
privilege, and duty as major focal points of his life. One duty of a
banriith is to work at increasing his race's influence throughout the
subsurface world. This young banriith, just recently having reached his
majority, has been extremely lucky. He was fortunate enough to get the
opportunity to commission a very experienced talriith to do some
exploring in his name. That exploration led to the discovery of the
armory of the ruined High Drow city. Leading a raid/survey expedition to
the site to increase the Riithi knowledge of this region and bring back
a large cache of weapons and other treasures will definitely raise his
social standing amongst the rest of the banriithi. Slight of build, high
in intelligence, and regal in bearing, he has some features about his
face and upper body that look more elven than orcish or ogrish. He is
wearing a brightly colored and highly decorated gown, soft soled boots
and an ornamented helm that leaves his ears and the lower half of his
face exposed.*

## Comments

This mob is especially problematic to kill, because he is in a room with
three other highly armored, powerful mobs. If you are hero level,
consider going [Invis](Invis "wikilink") (they can't see due to the
level difference), and [Charm
Person](Charm_Person "wikilink")/[Domination](Domination "wikilink") the
mob you want to kill. Then either pull them into the adjacent room, or
order them to kill themselves by telling them to toss or trip
themselves. If the mob fails toss/trip, the mob will begin killing
itself.
