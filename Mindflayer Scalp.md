This item loads on the ground in "keep" portion of [Astral
Proper](:Category:Astral_Plane "wikilink"). From shift portal to gith
soldier or gith prisoner (there are several and you want the one who is
located in a tiny cell) to reach this portion of the area. The
[key](Intricate_Key "wikilink") to the room is held by one of the
githyanki knights, although the door is bashable by one with sufficient
strength. This ticket will not repop while you remain in the area.

You give this ticket to Z'ier Uku on the 2nd floor of [Rietta's
Wonders](:Category:Rietta's_Wonders "wikilink") to get the [Githyanki
Bone Staff](Githyanki_Bone_Staff "wikilink"), which is a sanc brandish.

You give a mindflayer scalp to Z'ier Uku. A wicked grin crosses the
Githzerai's face, and he stuffs the scalp into a satchel. For a minute
it seems as though you will not be rewarded for your efforts, until he
pulls a short staff of bone from his bag, "This is made of Githyanki
bone, and it pains me to touch the heinous thing. Maybe YOU can use it."

He thrusts the ugly thing into your hands with a sneer.

Z'ier Uku gives you a Githyanki bone staff!
