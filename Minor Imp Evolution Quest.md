<em> The Oracle exclaims 'So it seems your kind still know enough to
seek me out!'

The Oracle says 'Well now little misfit ... you have come to the right
place. I might be the only person left who can help you.'

The Oracle giggles.

The Oracle says 'There are several items I require and then perhaps I
will show you something.'

The Oracle says 'First I will need blood from Ma'Klyn's altar.'

The Oracle says 'I'll then be needing some fish scales.'

The Oracle exclaims 'Finally I'll need an eye of newt to complete the
potion and begin the ritual!'

The Oracle says 'Go and find each of these and return them to me.' </em>

Spoilers:

In [Land Of The Fire Newts](Land_Of_The_Fire_Newts "wikilink") there is
an [The Oracle](The_Oracle "wikilink"). Give the [The
Oracle](The_Oracle "wikilink") 1 gold coin, she will then tell you that
you need to get 3 items for her. [Glimmering
Scales](Glimmering_Scales "wikilink"), [Elixir Of Crimson
Blood](Elixir_Of_Crimson_Blood "wikilink") and [An Eye Of
Newt](An_Eye_Of_Newt "wikilink").

Give her the [Glimmering Scales](Glimmering_Scales "wikilink") and
[Elixir Of Crimson Blood](Elixir_Of_Crimson_Blood "wikilink"), one at a
time, and she will convert them into tickets with a funky bright color
rename. Then give her the [An Eye Of Newt](An_Eye_Of_Newt "wikilink").

She will then give you a scroll. Give the scroll back to her and she
will then bind it to you and give it back. Now you only need to get to
level 25 and evolve.

Warning: Do NOT get rid of the scroll because it is needed for the [Dust
Imp Evolution Quest](Dust_Imp_Evolution_Quest "wikilink").
