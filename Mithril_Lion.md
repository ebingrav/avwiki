*Shining bright in the reflections of the light here, the lion looks you
deep in the eyes.  
His massive head, about six feet high from the ground, sways slowly, and
his huge manes shake. A low growl emanates from his throat, and sharp
claws appear on his big massive paws. A lion this size would be a threat
to most creatures that cross his path anyways, but this one shines like
mithril!  
Instead of fur, its skin is made out of this precious metal!*
