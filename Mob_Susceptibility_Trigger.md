I've started creating a set of triggers that tracks mob susceptibility
to maximize amplify damage. Here's a basic set of variables and trigger
that you can use. Just 'look <mob> race' and it will automatically sort
through a db and echo what spell would be optimal for single target and
area spell. Currently working on another set of triggers to keep track
of all fighting mobs to maximize automatically, however the db is/will
be huge since it will have to track every mob in game.
