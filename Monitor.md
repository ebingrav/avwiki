    1 MONITOR
    Syntax: monitor <player>
            monitor < self | off >               [Clears monitor setting]

Monitor allows you to keep an eye on another player, usually the one
who's tanking your group. This information shows up in your prompt, but
only if you put the %w and %W variables in it. %w represents current hp
of the target, and %W the max hp of the target. See HELP PROMPT for more
information.

This cannot be changed while in combat unless you are a cleric using a
specific spell ([Saving Grace](Saving_Grace "wikilink")).
