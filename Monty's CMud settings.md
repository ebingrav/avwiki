The following are just about all the settings that I use currently.

EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE FOR AMPLIFY: On kill trigger, it check the mob
against a database of mobs and their races.

gtell .ra will activate a feature to check the mob you're currently
fighting and tell you what spell to amplify.

Things to remember:

**\*\*EDIT\*\* Backstab spam has been fixed in-game. Filter -stabother
required for accurate damage counting**

1\. 'promptset' is required to use many of these triggers

2\. There are toggle buttons at the top set up as gauges for certain
triggersets.

3\. the variable @charnames must be set in order for login triggers to
function properly

4\. 'reset' before each run. If your character has not reset before,
counters will not function correctly.

5\. c id typhus, if you want status to update Charges left in status
bar.

6\. the class "Spunj" under "group" is used for kill triggers and
entering portals and going to sanc with the tank and/or leader.

7\. The 'Hog' toggle will prevent autosaving.

8\. The 'Gurney' toggle will autogurney people who shift that are in
@dead variable.
