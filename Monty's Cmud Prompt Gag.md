**Here is a beta copy of my Gag Prompt Triggers.**

Although your prompt gets gagged, you will see an echo any time you
lose/gain hp and mana.

This is a simple alias to set your prompt(I would recommend config
-blank):
![](Monty_PromptSet_Alias_XML.txt "Monty_PromptSet_Alias_XML.txt")

This is the triggers that gags the prompt, grabs values and sets up
variables:
![](Monty_PromptGag_Trig_XML.txt "Monty_PromptGag_Trig_XML.txt")

These are gauges that i use in order to have a visual reference of
stats: ![](Monty_Gauges_XML.txt "Monty_Gauges_XML.txt")

This is a simple counter that I use for a lag timer:
![](Monty_Lagcount_XML.txt "Monty_Lagcount_XML.txt")

**Along with gauges, I also put '@flags' into my StatusBar so you can
see afk/sanc/frenzy/sneak/move hidden/etc so if you have a custom
status, you can just toss that in there.**

*Feel free to note me on board 2 to Monty, Tabion, Chrom, and Barkhound
if you have questions or problems.*

Here's a pic of what these gauges look like (Taken from my main CMud
page): ![](MontySettingsScreen.png "MontySettingsScreen.png")
