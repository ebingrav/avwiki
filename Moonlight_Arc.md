Before you try to get this piece of gear, you would be wise to study the
map!

[Portal](Teleport.md "wikilink") "drid hunt". This will take you to the
portion of the area labeled "In the web" on the map.

From here head to the northwest corner, where you will find a hole
leading down. Go all the way down until you're on the base floor of the
area. Now venture into the dangerous Golden Web, which is in the
southeast corner of the floor.

You need to let yourself get pummeled by [Lloth-ra
Knights](Lloth-ra_Knight.md "wikilink"). Instead of killing you, they
will get you to 10hp and capture you, dragging you to the [Priestess
Queen](Priestess_Queen "wikilink"). Note that these knights won't drag
lords, so don't bother trying to get this item with your lord alt. The
only mobs to drag you to the [Priestess
Queen](Priestess_Queen "wikilink") are the [Lloth-ra
Knights](Lloth-ra_Knight "wikilink"). The
[Web-tenders](Web-tender "wikilink") and [Drider
Priestess](Drider_Priestess "wikilink") will not.

Here are some rumors about the [Priestess
Queen](Priestess_Queen "wikilink"). Remove the question marks, or edit
the list, as these rumors are proved or disproved.

-   Her hitpoints don't regen after she's been injured?
-   She doesn't wield her bow
-   She's aggie
-   She detects invis and move hidden
-   She can be blackjacked
-   You can't quit in her room.
-   Occasionally she'll attack so fast you won't have time to get a
    quaff in
-   If she kills you, she's nice enough to drop your corpse off in the
    room labelled "Arachling nest" on the map

1.  All the above have been tested and are true

The [Priestess Queen](Priestess_Queen "wikilink") herself isn't too
tough. Maybe you'll be able to survive by quaffing in full ac until
you're healthy. Edit this page with strategies that work for you:

-   A Cle in full hitgear can keep themselves alive with Divinity.

-   I managed to get a few of these with a hero 156 cen mage. First I
    tried to get to the queen and cr myself a bunch of times with just a
    ball of light as eq just to make sure I wouldn't lose my good ac.
    Then I used full ac, split spell, -1365 ac (NOTE: this ac requires
    nearly an entire dbrill ac set). I speedwalked s3w2s4dnw3de2s4e from
    drow spectre and got myself pummeled by the knights to get dragged
    to the queen. Then I quaffed a [glacial
    milk](glacial_milk "wikilink") and killed the queen without her even
    scratching me. Once she was dead I regened there and camped a few
    repops with just sanctuary on. That cost me like 500 hp, three surge
    2 disints and one regular disint per repop.
-   I did it (level 700ish arc) and the only problem was getting to the
    golden web. I did it all by myself and at one point I was fleeing
    from like 10 beasts. Once you get to the web though, not a problem.
    When they take you to the room immediately start quaffing. I had no
    problem killing her. I had -772 ac (spelled) and she was doing a max
    of \*\*DECIMATING\*\*.
-   In mediocre solo gear and full spells, plan on 10 dheals or so for
    killing the queen when you are dragged (you may want to bring extra
    in case of an ugly repop).
-   Gia war mediocre gear 68/65 was able to kill queen with about 5
    dheal and full spells, but the first couple quaffs were cutting it a
    bit close. She's demonic, so protection evil helps.
-   Although the [Drider Priestess](Drider_Priestess "wikilink") doesn't
    drag you, here's an interesting twist. They might hit you into
    EXPIRE range if you're lucky so your body is still twitching there,
    and the Lloth guards will still hit you and drag you. You will
    arrive at the queen with 10 hp. Quaff dheal, lather rinse repeat.
