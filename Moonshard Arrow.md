[fletch](Fletch "wikilink") [moonshard
arrows](Moonshard_Arrows "wikilink").*

These arrows, created by ancient drow, cast an affect similar to the
[Sorcerer](:Category:Sorcerers "wikilink") spell
[unrest](Unrest "wikilink"), in addition to doing damage. The spell,
delivered in such a visceral manner, is harder for enemies to resist.

Note: These arrows are only "useful" when mobs fire them **at** the
player, since mobs have no need to rest in order to recuperate hp -
making these arrows effectively worthless when compared to other ammo
types.

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [fletch](Fletch "wikilink")
