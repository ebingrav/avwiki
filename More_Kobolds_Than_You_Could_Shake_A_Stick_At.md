*It is said that once in every generation the kobold numbers grow to
such an enormous size that some kind of instinct causes these crazed
creatures to gather into ever increasingly large swarms, bent on nothing
more than their own self destruction, and whoever else's they can find
along the way. Of course, kobold generations are much more frequent than
those of other races...*
