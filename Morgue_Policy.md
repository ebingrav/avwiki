If you fail to retrieve your corpse in time, it will be magically
transported to the morgue for safe keeping. After the waiting period is
up, you can pay a fee (HELP [MORGUE COSTS](Morgue_Costs "wikilink")) to
retrieve your lost items. Note that [draconian](Draconians "wikilink")
corpses cannot be preserved in the morgue. Instead, they rot and spill
onto the ground.

Corpses are only stored in the morgue if they are "non-empty". Certain
low-value items (gold, balls of light) will not cause a corpse to be
considered "non-empty".

Besides corpses, the ONLY items that are preserved in the morgue are
INSURED containers and items. Please see HELP
[INSURE](Insure "wikilink") for more information about insurance.

Insured items are stored in the morgue following such events:

-   Gear imp (timer runs out)
-   Stomp
-   Detonate
-   Magic damage (failure to smith)
-   Breath attack
-   Shatter strike

The waiting period for insured gear is TRIPLE that of lost corpses. This
type of protection is provided to all players, including draconians.
Thus, if a draconian's corpse rots and their insured gear imps, they
will still be able to retrieve it from the morgue.

When an insured container is destroyed, all of its contents are
preserved in the morgue, regardless of whether or not they were also
insured. When an insured container (or PC corpse) is lost, ALL of the
contents will be associated with the OWNER of the container in the
morgue. This potentially includes insured objects owned by another
character!

Otherwise, insured items are associated with their OWNER in the morgue.
If you have [ALTOF](Altof "wikilink") set up, this may be different than
the character who was using the gear when it was destroyed!

Insurance is cancelled when an object is destroyed. This prevents you
from bypassing the morgue to get your objects back. When you redeem your
objects they will automatically be reinsured. The exception to this rule
is when an ALTOF is retrieving insured items that belong to the main
character. In this scenario, it is YOUR responsibility to re-insure the
retrieved items using your main alt.

Items destroyed through the use of gear modification spells & skills
(enchant, sharpen, transmute, etc.) are expressly NOT preserved in the
morgue.
