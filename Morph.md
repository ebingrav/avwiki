51 MORPH Syntax: morph <password>

To morph is to attempt to ascend to a higher level of mortal existence.
At level 300 or greater, a hero may attempt to morph into a Lord.
Attempting to morph is risky, but if you are successful, you will effect
your own transformation and that transforming energy will refresh and
renew the realm.

In case of failure though, the residual pain left by the attempt will
prevent a renewed try for a time and negatively impact on your ability
to gain experience from your travels for that duration.

The closer you are to hero level 999, the better chance you have for a
successful transformation and the lower the potential strength of
failure pain. Even with success, you will find yourself near death.

If you succesfully ascend to a higher level prior to reaching the
highest sublevel of the hero tier, your understanding and power will be
advanced to that point before the full transformation. However, this
will happen without any boons or penalties from your chosen deity - and
with a small cut to the practices gained from the swift influx of
experiences.

## Comments

Some players will attempt to maximize their gains (i.e., their base lord
1 stats) at hero through two strategies:

-   Choosing a worship that provides a boost to hp/mana gains (e.g.
    Quixoltan, Roixa, etc.). When your morph before 999, you are given
    the remainder of your hero gains as if you were an "atheist"
    worship, that is, without worship gains. Choosing a state boosting
    deity and leveling to 999 will net you the additional stats these
    worships provide.
-   When you level at 999 (and config +automorph is on), you have a
    chance to continue levelling and gaining additional stats.

Maximizing hero gains can be beneficial for races/classes with small hp
pools (e.g. Sprites, Sorcerers) so that they start lord with slightly
higher hp.

For players morphing before 999, see some discussion on the [Optimum
Morph Level](Optimum_Morph_Level "wikilink")

## Stat mods

Hit points and mana have a modifier that is applied to hero 999 HP and
mana to figure lord HP and mana. Here are some known ones:

## Probability

According to a note on board 7 from Pulse dated April 1, 2010, the
probability of a successful morph is as follows:

-   the chance of successfully morphing at Hero 300 will be
    approximately 20%, rising to 50% at Hero 500 and further to 100% at
    Hero 999
-   should the morph be failed, there will no longer be a level loss
    penalty - instead all xp gained will be halved for a number of
    levels. The amount of levels of penalty will be approximately 50
    sub-levels for a fail at Hero 300, but will reduce at higher
    sub-levels
-   on a successful early morph the character will be advanced to Hero
    999 as atheist (that is no change). A small practice penalty will be
    deducted to compensate for the bypassed risk of stat-loss.

The following chart is generated by data from [Avatar's Twitter
Feed](User:WinterRose/Morph_Data "wikilink") using 2200 data points over
20 months.

![ \| \| \|Morph Success
Chart](Morph,dataset.png " | | |Morph Success Chart")

-   The Trendline is a linear average of collected data points.
-   Expected values are those based on Pulse's note.

Result: since those two lines are close to one another, we can safely
conclude that the data collected is sufficient for a rough chart of
acceptable accuracy.
