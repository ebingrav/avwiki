*This field of storm is nothing like the others, the menace of it seems
much more calculated: powerful bolts of lightning dart at your weapons,
while a piercing agony fills your mind as something tries to force a way
in. All the while the blasts of icy air threaten to throw you off your
feet, playing with you like a weak blade of grass.*

## Comments

*With a blast of lightning ripping along the whole length of the canyon
the storm implodes.*

This mob detonates. Spawns when an [assemblage of ice
splinters](Assemblage_Of_Ice_Splinters.md "wikilink") is killed (scans
as: "This assemblage of tiny ice needles pulses rapidly.").

Drops a small diamond when killed.
