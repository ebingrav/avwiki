*This gigantic six-foot long slug has just given birth to a litter of
rowdy, rambunctious baby slugs, and is slowly regaining her strength
from that ordeal. She moves slowly, when she moves, watching as her new
brood races around like little underground tornadoes, expanding the nest
in their wanderings. The large bulbous eyes on the ends of her four
eye-stalks are constantly moving as she lumbers about, making sure
nothing invades the nest to threaten her precious youngsters.*

## Comments

This mob can be [skinned](Skin_Corpse.md "wikilink") to make the
[Slagwalkers](Slagwalkers "wikilink"). Since its children are
[corpse-eaters](Corpse-Eating_Mobs.md "wikilink"), those wanting to
[skin](Skin.md "wikilink") its corpse may wish to
[summon](Summon.md "wikilink") it to another location before killing it;
also, giving it an object (like a cookie or magic light) before killing
it may help to keep its corpse from instantly decomposing at death, as
it will otherwise do on occasion.
