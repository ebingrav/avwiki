This quest rewards the player with the [Mountain Adventurer
Insignia](Mountain_Adventurer_Insignia "wikilink") and involves
[Mountain Tunnels](:Category:Mountain_Tunnels.md "wikilink") and
[Halfling's Paradise](:Category:Halfling's_Paradise.md "wikilink") areas
on [Eragora](:Category:Eragora.md "wikilink").

To be eligible to start this quest you must not have done the [Halfling
Detective Quest](Halfling_Detective_Quest "wikilink"), or if you have,
you must have also done the [Half-Orc Redemption
Quest](Half-Orc_Redemption_Quest "wikilink") to nullify it.

-   Once on Eragora, portal to [Halfling Spy](Halfling_Spy "wikilink")
    and go 2s to meet [Madak](Madak "wikilink"), the half-orc captain,
    in a safe room. He will require papers to open the gates (the
    *official* method of entrance). If he doesn't wish to talk to you,
    you have arrived at an inopportune time - his business hours are
    during the in-game day.
-   Portal to [Old Fisherman](Old_Fisherman "wikilink") and walk 2n, 2e,
    d, w, n.
-   Scan for [Frantic Messenger](Frantic_Messenger "wikilink") and once
    you locate him, kill him for the Ulexite sphere. (This halfling
    dashes down the corridor in a rush somewhere.)
-   Avoid Deacon's room or you will probably splat.
-   Since he wanders follow these directions from the water room after
    you went down: 2w, 4n (you are very likely to get aggied at 2n), 2w.
-   Give the sphere to the scribe, receive forged papers.
-   Portal to Halfling spy, move 2s, and deliver the papers to Madak.
-   Receive the [Mountain Adventurer
    Insignia](Mountain_Adventurer_Insignia "wikilink") and the gates
    will open to enter the area proper.

As a side-effect, this effect should render the half-orcs within the
area (or just the maze?) non-aggressive.

To switch this insignia for the [Halfling "Detective"
Insignia](Halfling_"Detective"_Insignia "wikilink"), you will be
required to perform the [Halfling Redemption
Quest](Halfling_Redemption_Quest "wikilink") and then the [Halfling
Detective Quest](Halfling_Detective_Quest "wikilink").
