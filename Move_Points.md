''Move points control how quickly and how far a player can move before
being forced to stop and rest. When you run out, you can't move. Certain
types of [terrain](:Category:_Terrains.md "wikilink"), such as
[deserts](Desert_Terrain.md "wikilink"), are tougher to traverse and
therefore [take](Movement_Costs.md "wikilink") more moves per room. A
higher [constitution](Constitution.md "wikilink") will regenerate move
points more quickly.

*Movement Points are also considered Action Points for Hero+ Levels. All
physical activities such as fighting, casting spells, and other have an
action point cost associated with them. AP are not currently assessed,
but they may be reinstated in the future. For now, enjoy your unfettered
activity while it lasts!*

*Movement gains are determined by
[constitution](Constitution.md "wikilink"),
[dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"),
[class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink"), and
[race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink").*

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may
[wear](Wear.md "wikilink") [gear to increase their move
points](:Category:_Move-Point_Gear.md "wikilink").
