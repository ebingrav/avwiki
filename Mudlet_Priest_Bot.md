This is a very basic collecting of triggers and scripts to help people
get started botting using Mudlet. It is intended to be the framework for
a more comprehensive bot, should you wish to add to it.

-   This package is made for use on a
    [Priest](:Category:_Priests.md "wikilink").
-   It is always enabled.
-   It uses GMCP data for stats.

To get started:

-   Download the .zip file (Copy this link to your browser, the Wiki
    won't let me create an actual link.):
    drive.google.com/file/d/1lZb6Adq7FlDhf75DKIEWvJXhKWQ2pwIQ/view?usp=sharing
-   Extract the .mpackage file.
-   In Mudlet, go to the Package Manager.
-   Click 'Install new package' and browse to the location of the
    .mpackage file.
-   Select the 'Mudlet Priest Bot Package.mpackage' file and click open.

If you run into any issues with this package, send a note to Martyr on
board 2.

A few tips and tricks for botting a priest:

-   Use gear that provides detect hidden/detect invis such as
    [Heart-Shaped Amulet](Heart-Shaped_Amulet "wikilink").
-   Set config -savespell for exhausts such as Solitude and
    Intervention.
-   Set config +nodisturb to stay asleep.
-   Set config +noautomove to not follow people out of the room when you
    preach.
