*With the knowledge gained from his [Assassin's
Sight](Assassin_Sight "wikilink"), a
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") using this
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") attempts to kill his opponent with
one deadly, well-placed strike. Would-be assassins should be aware,
however, that merely slitting the throat or piercing the heart of many
higher level creatures is not enough to kill them. The murder
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") is NOT an "instant death" attack.
It does considerable damage, enough to fell most smaller foes, but only
enough to grievously wound higher level prey. Murder requires a piercing
weapon, and can only be used to initiate combat. However, since it is
less dependant on the element of surprise than
[backstab](Backstab "wikilink"), it can be used on less healthy foes.
This [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") is less effective against
[monsters](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") with no real anatomy (like
elementals) and completely useless against the
[undead](Undead_Mobs "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Assassin Sight](Assassin_Sight "wikilink"), [Rogue
Lore](Rogue_Lore "wikilink").

Syntax: murder \<[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink")\>.
