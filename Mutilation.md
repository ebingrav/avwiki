*The Rite furthers the Scarification skill. With the same scar command,
a Berserker can trigger spell-like affects similar to existing magic
such as frenzy.*

*[Bloodlust](Bloodlust "wikilink") is a prerequisite for Mutilation.*

*This is a [Rite](Rite "wikilink"), not a [skill](skill "wikilink").*

This is an extremely handy rite for lord Berserkers. They can easily get
Sanctuary or Frenzy themselves, instead of having to ask for it from a
group mate, even in the middle of a fight. They can get a number of
spells with this, including:
[Confidence,](:Category:Grandfathered_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink")
Anticipate, Stone Skin, Regeneration, Frenzy, Sanctuary, and, last but
not least, [Werrebocler](Werrebocler "wikilink"). Some effects come
easier than others. Werrebocler notably is harder to get. Like normal
spells these will save when sleeping with config +savespell, if the
usual conditions are met.
