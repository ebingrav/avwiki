*Tacitus maintains an aura of mystery, as he may go for days without
uttering a word to anyone and, even when he does speak, will rarely
utter more than three words together; two of those words were his full
name Tacitus Eremitglen. Although extremely reserved, he has earned
great respect from his peers by being a remarkably hard and tireless
worker, constantly searching for ways to make himself useful and readily
undertaking even the most menial of tasks.*

*He wears a most peculiar amulet that he is never without and that seems
to have some intense sentimental value to him, although it seems
unlikely that anyone but he will ever know why he cherishes it so.*
