*Once affected with a mystical barrier, damage upon you from
[spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") is reduced slightly. It was
considered a good idea by several [magi](:Category:_Mages "wikilink") in
the southern regions of Yult'Nea where the mosquitoes were casting tiny
fireballs to help cook their meal before feasting on
[magi](:Category:_Mages "wikilink") flesh. A spell repellent was quickly
produced. The causes of spell innovation are always interesting.*

Prerequisite(s): [Shield](Shield "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'mystical barrier'.

[Hero](:Category:_Hero "wikilink") [mages](:Category:_Mages "wikilink")
may find it worthwhile to include this
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") when
[buffing](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Buff_Characters "wikilink")
themselves fully, especially if they are expecting to fight
[spellcasting mobs](Spellcasting_Mobs "wikilink") or mobs with [a breath
attack](Racial_Breath "wikilink"). This
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink")'s duration is relatively low, just
like that of [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") and
[Frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink").
