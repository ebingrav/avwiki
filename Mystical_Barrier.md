*Once affected with a mystical barrier, damage upon you from
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") is reduced slightly. It was
considered a good idea by several [magi](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink")
in the southern regions of Yult'Nea where the mosquitoes were casting
tiny fireballs to help cook their meal before feasting on
[magi](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink") flesh. A spell repellent was
quickly produced. The causes of spell innovation are always
interesting.*

Prerequisite(s): [Shield](Shield.md "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'mystical barrier'.

[Hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink")
[mages](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink") may find it worthwhile to
include this [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") when
[buffing](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Buff_Characters.md "wikilink")
themselves fully, especially if they are expecting to fight
[spellcasting mobs](Spellcasting_Mobs.md "wikilink") or mobs with [a
breath attack](Racial_Breath.md "wikilink"). This
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink")'s duration is relatively low,
just like that of [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink") and
[Frenzy](Frenzy.md "wikilink").
