To start this quest you need [a blue crystal
bracelet](Blue_Crystal_Bracelet.md "wikilink") carried by [Shiaana
NaamTer'Sa](Shiaana_NaamTer'Sa "wikilink").  
Give [a blue crystal bracelet](Blue_Crystal_Bracelet.md "wikilink") to
the librarian 2w3s of [NaamSa scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink"). The
librarian will give you [a tight knot](Tight_Knot.md "wikilink").  
Give the tight knot to [Tean NaamAhn'Sa](Tean_NaamAhn'Sa "wikilink").
Tean NaamAhn'Sa will give you [a staring
eye](Staring_Eye.md "wikilink").  
Give a staring eye to [Naambres'Shoo](Naambres'Shoo "wikilink").
NaamBres'Shoo will give you [a bright blue crystal
ball](Bright_Blue_Crystal_Ball.md "wikilink").  
Give a bright blue crystal ball to [Tean
NaamAhn'Sa](Tean_NaamAhn'Sa "wikilink"). Tean NaamAhn'Sa will give you
[NaamAhn'Sa Token](NaamAhn'Sa_Token "wikilink").

pp [Naamsa Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink") find the statue with the silver
crystal disk in it and grab the disk. There are three silver crystal
disks total in three different statues. You only need one of these keys.
From [Naamsa Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink") they are 1w1n, 1e1n and
1e2n1w. Next you will need the golden crystal disk. There are three ways
to get to these.  
Route 1: From [Naamsa Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink") go 2e4s1w and push
eyes. This will open a down. Go 2d then 1n1e3n use the silver disk to
unlock the dome and get the gold disk. Go 2w and get the second golden
crystal disk then 2s and get the third golden crystal disk. The gold
disks are keys to hidden doors on the surface. (You only need one gold
disk to unlock the door to [Shiaana
NaamTer'Sa](Shiaana_NaamTer'Sa "wikilink"), but they each open a
different door).  
Route 2: From [Naamsa Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink") go 2w1n1w1n2w1s1w
and push mouth. This will open a down. Go 2d then 1e1s1e use the silver
disk to unlock the dome and get the gold disk. Go 2n and get the second
golden crystal disk then 2e and get the third golden crystal disk.  
Route 3: From [Naamsa Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink") go 2e2s2e1n and push
ears. This will open a down. Go 2d then 1w1n1w use the silver disk to
unlock the dome and get the gold disk. Go 2w and get the second golden
crystal disk then 2s and get the third golden crystal disk.  
Next you will need a bright blue crystal disk. In the rooms between the
mounds with the golden disks you need to find "A form, covered thick
with slime, protrudes from the wall." At one of these push eyes, mouth,
ears or you can try push 1. to open a door. Go the direction that the
door opened. You should now be in a room called "A silver crystal
sphere". Use the silver disk and unlock up. Go up and kill the shade
with the blue crystal disk. You could also use the [Dark Crystal
Sphere](Dark_Crystal_Sphere "wikilink") from Shianna (if you were doing
this in the intended order...) as a ticket. You should now have all the
keys that you need.

Go south and you'll end up back at the [Naamsa
Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink").

Now that you have all the needed keys, you need to get [a blue crystal
bracelet](Blue_Crystal_Bracelet.md "wikilink") from [Shiaana
NaamTer'Sa](Shiaana_NaamTer'Sa "wikilink"). You can follow the
directions for the [the book of rune](Book_Of_Rune.md "wikilink"), you
can track Shianna or you can follow one of the below routes.  
Route 1: From [Naamsa Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink") go 2e2s1e2n unlock
and open down then go 2d1w2s1w to [Shiaana
NaamTer'Sa](Shiaana_NaamTer'Sa "wikilink").  
Route 2: From [Naamsa Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink") go 2w1n1w3n1w unlock
and open down then go 2d1e2s1e to [Shiaana
NaamTer'Sa](Shiaana_NaamTer'Sa "wikilink").  
Route 3: From [Naamsa Scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink") go 2w1n1w1n2w2s
unlock and open down then go 2d11n1e1n1e to [Shiaana
NaamTer'Sa](Shiaana_NaamTer'Sa "wikilink").  
\>\>\>\>Be careful, there is a corpse animator (Hopes of Remembrance) in
the area should you die\<\<\<\<  
  
\>\>\>\>THE SWARM OF CRYSTALS DETONATE  
  
Now that you have the [blue crystal
bracelet](Blue_Crystal_Bracelet.md "wikilink") you can begin turning in
the tickets.  
Give the [blue crystal bracelet](Blue_Crystal_Bracelet.md "wikilink") to
the librarian 2w3s of [NaamSa scribe](Scribe.md "wikilink"). The
librarian will give you [a tight knot](Tight_Knot.md "wikilink").  
Give the [a tight knot](Tight_Knot.md "wikilink") to [Tean
NaamAhn'Sa](Tean_NaamAhn'Sa "wikilink"). Tean NaamAhn'Sa will give you
[a staring eye](Staring_Eye.md "wikilink"). Follow the directions to get
the golden disks if you don't know how to find Tean NaamAhn'Sa. He will
be wandering in the area.  
Give [a staring eye](Staring_Eye.md "wikilink") to
[Naambres'Shoo](Naambres'Shoo "wikilink"). NaamBres'Shoo will give you
[a bright blue crystal ball](Bright_Blue_Crystal_Ball.md "wikilink").
NaamBres'Shoo is in the room down from [Shiaana
NaamTer'Sa](Shiaana_NaamTer'Sa "wikilink"). This is where you need the
blue crystal disk that you got from the shade. (If you want to get
[Minor Eye Of Naambres'Shoo](Minor_Eye_Of_Naambres'Shoo "wikilink")
while you are here, kill [Naambres'Shoo](Naambres'Shoo "wikilink") and
take his corpse. I would suggest closing the up to prevent an aggressive
wandering sanc'd mob from wandering in.)  
Now go back to [Tean NaamAhn'Sa](Tean_NaamAhn'Sa "wikilink") and give
him the [bright blue crystal
ball](Bright_Blue_Crystal_Ball.md "wikilink"). Tean NaamAhn'Sa will give
you [NaamAhn'Sa Token](NaamAhn'Sa_Token "wikilink").
