*Our current rules on acceptable names are as follows:*

-   It shouldn't be political or religious, like BillClinton or ThePope.
-   It shouldn't reference drugs, alcohol, disease or illness.
-   It may not be vulgar or sexually explicit in any way.
-   It may not have a prefix of "Angel", as we have
    [Angels](:Category:_Angels.md "wikilink") on the staff.
-   It may not have Roman numerals at the end, such as ArkinIV and
    SueII, because our staff uses this system for alternate
    [Immortal](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink")
    [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink").
-   It may not have more than 4 first letters in common with an
    [Immortal](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink") name. For instance,
    Mendus is acceptable, whereas Mendes is not. If you are not familiar
    with our staff, and accidentally choose a name that is unacceptable
    this way, you will be asked to choose a new one.

*If you want to be in-theme (optional):*

-   It shouldn't be anything modern, like Motorcycle or Telephone.
-   It shouldn't be related to movies/TV, like LukeSkywalker or
    ClarkKent.
-   It shouldn't be celebrity names, like MelGibson or CindyCrawford.
-   It shouldn't be full names, like JohnSmith or MaryJones.
-   It shouldn't include initials, like BobG or TSmith.
-   It shouldn't be related to modern music, like Hanson or MotleyCrue.
-   It shouldn't contain surnames like MrBrown, LordJerry or SirRobin.
-   It shouldn't be overly frivolous, like GooglyEyes or Pookiebear.
-   It shouldn't include articles, like BiffTheButcher or TheMaster.

*The staff may ask someone to change their name at any time, even if it
has existed for a significant length of time. Our name policy is pretty
fair and the few things we do not permit will be enforced strictly.*
