**Hints:**  
\*To get [this item](Namure's_Leather_Collar "wikilink") you will have
to prove your worthiness to [Namure](Namure "wikilink"). Bring her
evidence that you've dispatched a great foe of the
[monks](:Category:Monks "wikilink") of [Gorn's
anchor](:Category:Gorn's_Anchor "wikilink").  
\*A large or properly prepared hero can obtain the required ticket on
their own.  
\*Characters in the upper 40s are recommended to employ a well-rounded
group, especially one who can cast [invisibility](invis "wikilink"). Be
sure to avoid any [flying](Fly "wikilink") enemies, as they will cause
trouble.  
\*The commander may need to be skinned by an archer.  
This is not bogus gear, and it can be useful for UD, since it provides
svs.  
The ticket for this quest is head of the [iadh
commander](iadh_commander "wikilink") which you obtain by skinning the
corpse of The [iadh commander](iadh_commander "wikilink").

*You give head of the iadh commander to Namure, the Hand of Gorn.*
*Namure takes the head from you and examines it closely.* *"Yes," she
says, "this is the remains of the iadh commander,* *is it not? I am
grateful that you have struck such a blow* *to the iadh race, however I
don't believe that this alone* *will stop the progress they have already
made. I think it* *is time for the monks of Gorn's Anchor to finally
purge the* *iadh presense from this island. Take [this
collar](Namure's_Leather_Collar "wikilink"). If you* *wish to help in
our cause, you will need its protection."* *Namure turns from you and
signals for you to leave, curt as* *ever.*

*Namure, the Hand of Gorn gives you [namure's leather
collar](Namure's_Leather_Collar "wikilink")!*
