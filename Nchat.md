Syntax: nchat <message>

This channel (also known as nchat) is received by all players on the
mud, but is generally used by newer players to seek help from the
community and staff. While chat can only be used by those with 3 or more
levels, nchat can be used by any level character. Thus, it is a new
player's primary source of communication.

If you are new, and need assistance, just type:

  
  
nchat Hi, I am new here - could somebody please help me?

Feel free to ask any questions you may have about the game, no matter
how trivial you might be afraid they are.
