*Clad in black robes, the Necromancer chuckles maniacally while creating
new undead. His right hand has been replaced by a claw and his face is
horribly scarred and disfigured. Slashes, cuts, scapes, burns and
bruises cover his face. He seeks to control ALL the undead on Avatar and
to rule the world with those undead. Recognizing your threat to his
plans, he prepares to add you to his army.*
