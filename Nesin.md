*The Left Eye Gang are hostile to outsiders, hating the pilgrims who
pollute their homes on their way to the Tears of Kra. They are poorly
organised but quite intimidating with their [military like
outfits](Crude_Black_Uniform "wikilink") and rudely chanted slogans.
Recently they've had quite a few run-ins with the Longbeards and
tensions are running high. Nesin isn't the brightest of
[dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") but he is big and strong and leads by
intimidation.*
