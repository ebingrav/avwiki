## New to AVATAR?

New to AVATAR and creating your first character (or two)? Here's some
general advice:

-   Most AVATAR players have multiple characters called "alts" so don't
    be afraid to experiment and there's no need to build your perfect
    character right from the start. (Note: multiplay, or playing more
    than one character at the same time, is forbidden except on mday -
    see help mday)
-   Your first few weeks of playing AVATAR will be at the lowmort
    (levels 1 to 50) and hero level so its worth considering how your
    initial character(s) will play at this level. Lord play will come
    later and shouldn't be the focus of your initial characters.
-   Low mort is mostly a solo affair these days however don't be afraid
    to ask for help. Hero play is mostly done in groups.

## Race / Class Recommendations

So what character to make first? Ultimately the choice is yours and
there’s no one right answer however with the choices below you won’t go
wrong:

-   **Just getting started and want to check out the game to see if you
    like it?** I’d recommend going
    **[Lizardman](Lizardmen.md "wikilink")
    [Warrior](:Category:_Warriors.md "wikilink")**. Warriors have the
    easiest early game experience with their high damage output and high
    hit points and they excel at both hitting and tanking. Lizardmen
    receive high hp gains and have [Racial
    Armorleather](Racial_Armorleather "wikilink") providing a reduction
    to damage received. Other recommend races to start with are Orc
    (higher damage output) or if you are thinking of going for one of
    the Warrior prestige classes
    ([Bodyguard](:Category:_Bodyguards.md "wikilink") or
    [Ripper](:Category:_Rippers.md "wikilink")), then Ogre is a good
    choice with the downside that they have a higher TNL (if going Ogre
    Bodyguard, only train your Intelligence to 15).

<!-- -->

-   **Are you enjoying the game and want to get into the hero
    gameplay?** I’d recommend going **[Dwarf](Dwarf "wikilink")
    [Archer](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink")** and then becoming a
    **[Fusilier](:Category:_Fusiliers.md "wikilink")** at level 50. Most
    hero gameplay occurs in groups with other players and until you have
    a large hero, it can be difficult to solo and collect gear for
    yourself. Fusiliers excel at soloing early and having a Fusilier as
    one of your first characters will allow you to collect hero gear for
    all your alts. They are an incredibly flexible class that can solo,
    hit in groups and even tank. Starting as a Dwarf will give you high
    hp while retaining the option of remorting into a powerful
    [Ignatur](Ignatur "wikilink") in the future. Another racial options
    is [Gnome](Gnome "wikilink") for nofail casting.

<!-- -->

-   **Do you want to play a spellcaster?** Then I recommend going
    **[Drow](Drow "wikilink") [Mage](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink")**.
    Mages (and subsequently Sorcerors and Wizards) become some of the
    strongest classes in the game at Lord however they can be
    challenging for a new player. As a new hero, mages have low hp and
    mana pools and contribute little to groups and thus are often
    required to solo or lead groups themselves. There is a good argument
    for creating at least a low hero mage early and that is for their
    ability to enchant gear. Combined with a Dwarf Fusilier (above), you
    would be able to farm gear with the Fusilier and then enchant it
    with your mage, giving you early access to some great gear making
    all future characters of yours that much more powerful. For racial
    options, I recommend Drow over Elf for the lower TNL. Other options
    include Gnome (which can prestige to Wizard at level 50) or
    Lizardman which are not great spellcasters however they have good hp
    and retain the ability to remort to the powerful
    [Tuataur](Tuataur "wikilink") or [Dragon](Dragon "wikilink") races.

<!-- -->

-   **Do you like to heal and support groups?** I’d recommend going
    **[Elf](Elf "wikilink") [Cleric](Cleric "wikilink")** and then
    becoming a **[Vizier](:Category:_Viziers.md "wikilink")**. The
    Vizier class has an interesting healing mechanic. They can mark mobs
    with the spell “final rites” which then gives a chance of a pool
    being created on their death. Vizier’s can pop these pools with the
    spell “sanguen pax”, a powerful healing spell which provides hp to
    the entire group. Vizier’s receive limited mana compared to other
    spell casters however they also receive the spell “phlebotomize”
    which when cast on an enemy near death, will do significant damage
    while providing mana recovery. The race Elf is recommended as an Elf
    makes for a good Cleric as well as Druid if the player decides to go
    those routes instead of Vizier. If one is certain they want to make
    a Vizier then a [Drow](Drow "wikilink") would be better than an Elf
    for the lower TNL. Additionally, a Gnome would also work. Centaurs
    make for some of the most powerful Druids and Vizier however they
    have a significantly higher TNL and it not recommended for an early
    character.

## Race Considerations

When choosing a race, there's a few things to consider:

-   What is the "TNL" of the race, i.e., how much experience points is
    required to level the race. The higher the TNL, the slower your
    levelling experience will be. For a first character, I'd recommend a
    TNL between 1052 and 1333.
-   How much HP and Mana will that race have? This is mostly determined
    by Constitution and Intelligence respectively.
-   Does the race have a [racial armor
    bonus](:Category:Racial_Armor.md "wikilink")? This will provide a
    flat reduction to damage received and keep you alive longer.
-   Does the race have a [racial damage / archer / sneak
    modifier](:Racial_Combat_Modifier.md "wikilink")? These will provide
    boosts to your damage depending on your class.
-   For spellcasters, is the race "nofail" on spells, meaning does it
    have a chance to fail when its casts or will it succeed every time.
    Additionally, do the race receive any special [spell cost reduction
    modifiers](:Racial_Spell_Cost_Modifier.md "wikilink"). The lower the
    spell cost, the more you can cast!
-   Do you plan to play one of the [remort
    races](:Category:Remort_Races.md "wikilink")? If so, ensure the race
    you're playing as meets the remort race conditions.

## Quests

### Diplomatic Corp (DC) Quests

These are an important set of quests to complete as they provide a
permanent boost to your stats throughout the life of your character,
eliminating the need for leveling gear. There are five quests in total
and you can complete one quest for levels 10 - 19, 20 - 29, etc. As the
quest ends with a fight against a miniboss, most players wait till the
ninth level in order to complete this quest. It is recommended to
upgrade your gear and skills before this battle. If you need help with
these quests, don't hesitate to ask for assistance on chat. Note that to
maximize the benefits of these quests, you need to successfully complete
four of the five (meaning its okay to fail / skip one). The quests get
harder each time with the fifth quest being the hardest by far so its
best not to skip an earlier one. See [Diplomatic
Corps](Diplomatic_Corps "wikilink") for details.

### Other Quests

There are several other early quests that provide nice bonuses but are
not essential to complete. These quests include: [Wayside Kobold Slayer
Quest](Wayside_Kobold_Slayer_Quest "wikilink") (+5% melee or spell
casting, complete before lvl 10), [Bonkers!
Quest](Bonkers!_Quest "wikilink") (+30hp/ma/mv, complete before level
10), and [Exemplary Citizen Award
Quest](Exemplary_Citizen_Award_Quest "wikilink") (free level, complete
before level 50, best used at level 40+). Additionally, the patrol
quests series are a fun way to gain a few free levels of the course of
your low mortal adventures. Start with the [Solace Patrol
Quest](Solace_Patrol_Quest "wikilink") between level 10 and 20.

## Other Important Info

### Training

In general, you always want to train Wis first, then Con, then Int in
order to maximize your practice point, hit point and mana gains per
level. Through gear, spells or quests, you can increase your stats by a
maximum of three over your max trainable (shown by the number in bracket
on the score screen)

### Worship

When you turn level 10, you'll likely want to worship a god. If you are
a melee class without much of a need for mana, Werredan is often a good
choice for its 10% bonus to XP and additional hp gained per level.
Similarly, for spell casters, Shizaga is a good choice for its 5% bonus
to XP and additional mana gained per level. You can see a full
comparison of the gods on the [Worship](Worship "wikilink") page and you
can visit your [Class](:Category:Classes.md "wikilink") page for some
class specific advice. If in doubt, send a message on chat and someone
is sure to

### Sanctum

AVATAR has a safe area called "Sanctum" where many players gather to
relax, form groups or enchant/fletch. It provides for a place to swap
gear and to regenerate missing hp/mana quickly. Players can reach the
Sanctum from any uncursed room on the continent by typing "sanctum" or
"sanc" for short. Most players meet in the room that is down and west
from there.

Notably, players are allowed to have "spell bots" in the infirmary
located in the infirmary at "sanc down west". These bots can provide you
with spells that can prove valuable on your journey. The druid bots (the
most common being Idle and Yorrick) can provide you with nearly a
complete spellup by sending them a tell with the command "full" (e.g.
tell idle full or tell yorrick full). They can also provide heals (e.g.,
tell idle heal) and portals (e.g., tell idle pp <portal point>). The bot
Neodox can provide you with steel skeleton (tell neodox steel) and
Martyr is a priest that can preach up a group (beckon martyr to join
your group and gtell preachup). The spells "sanctuary" and "frenzy" are
both quite powerful and have shorter durations than the rest of the
spells (16 tics vs 48 tics). You may want to consider returning to
Sanctum when they drop to refresh them (e.g. tell idle sanc or tell idle
frenzy).

If you plan to run your own spell up bot, be sure to consult the help
files and talk to others as there are very specific rules on how these
bots can be used (e.g., only in sanc d w, must be available to all).

### Companions

Throughout AVATAR, there are a number of [Adventurer's
Guild](Adventurer's_Guild "wikilink") where you can hire two companions
to join you on your journey and assist you in battle. This becomes
especially helpful if you're playing a spellcaster and at levels 41+.
For more information, see [Companions](Companions "wikilink").

### Where to level

Where to level: Exploration is half the fun and there's no race to
level. Visiting the can give you a full list of areas for your level.
However if you're struggling to find decent xp, this is a general
overview of the areas I visit. These level ranges assume you are fully
spelled and are of a relatively strong race/class. For spellcasters and
cleric types, you may need to level further in an easier area before
moving up a tier.

    hero level 9

## Remember to have fun!

A final note: How you play AVATAR is up to you. Some players like to try
to make their characters the strongest, others like to build characters
based on a theme/roleplayer while others like to experiment. There is no
one right way to play and all that really matters is that you're having
fun!
