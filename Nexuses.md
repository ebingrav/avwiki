These [objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") provide magical
two-way connections between [rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink").
Some are permanent fixtures in certain
[areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") or may be temporarily created as
part of certain [ticket quests](:Category:_Ticket_Quests.md "wikilink").
Others are temporary creations of
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") who
[cast](Cast.md "wikilink") '[nexus](Nexus.md "wikilink")'.

Nexuses may potentially "drain" certain small random amounts of [hit
points](Hit_Points.md "wikilink"), [mana
points](Mana_Points.md "wikilink"), and/or [move
points](Move_Points.md "wikilink") from
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") who travel through
them. Each individual nexus has a certain
[value](:Category:_Object_Values.md "wikilink") that determines this,
making its chances of "portal drain" on
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") either 0%, completely
random, or 100%.

Although traveling via nexus can never kill
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") directly, it can be
indirectly deadly for relatively-low-[level](Level.md "wikilink")
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") who, for example, may
arrive in a dangerous [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") with zero
[hit points](Hit_Points.md "wikilink"); by contrast,
relatively-high-[level](Level.md "wikilink")
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") with plenty of
[points](:Category:_Points.md "wikilink") have much less to fear and may
hardly ever notice any drain. [Mages](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink")
may [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") '[astral
shield](Astral_Shield.md "wikilink")' on
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") to prevent them from
experiencing any "portal drain" during transit.
