*Although the edges of this note are muddied and ripped, it is still
possible to make out the intent behind the note. It is addressed to Lady
Veyah, and within the dark, flowing words is a hidden message that
speaks of the driders planning a second assault, greater than the first
by far.  
*It seems this first regiment was only a group of spies, sent to scout
out the area. First the graveyard would be attacked, and then when it
fell, the drider army would scuttle into the necropolis and strike at
the heart of Veyah, rumored to be buried in some hidden room behind a
mountain of bones.''
