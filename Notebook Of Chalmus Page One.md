*On the way back from my trip, I came across a band of gypsies on the
[Dwarven Trade Route](:Category:Highways/Great_Wall "wikilink"). From
them I bought a few basic supplies, but also the most peculiar
[stone](Small_Grey_Stone "wikilink"). So far my experiments with the
mineral have been horribly fascinating, but I regret to admit that I've
gained little in the way of true knowledge about it. Essentially the
only thing I have deduced is that the stone is more powerful at night.
Some days it seems to completely obey my wishes, making even the most
difficult transmutations trivial. Other times I feel like I have no
control over it at all, as if I'm just a catalyst for this stone's
designs. I must be careful to keep the thing from [my
apprentice](Simon_MacAlvay "wikilink"), who has already exhibited a
fascination for it. I fear that he is too inexperienced to handle this
power responsibly, and it might consume him.*
