*Cousin to [the dryad](Dryad.md "wikilink"), the aquatic Nyad takes the
form of a stunning [elven](Elves.md "wikilink") woman with long green
hair. She notices you watching her and says, "In the name of the [High
Sylph](High_Sylph.md "wikilink") I require your assistance. If you would
prove yourself trustworthy, return to me [my wreath of water
lilies](Wreath_Of_Water_Lilies.md "wikilink"). It was stolen by one of
the [elves](Elves.md "wikilink") in these foothills. I worry that it may
fall into the claws of the driders within [the
Volcano](:Category:_Lloth's_Peak.md "wikilink"), who could use it as a
magical focus to destroy me."*
