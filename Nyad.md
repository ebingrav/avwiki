*Cousin to [the dryad](Dryad "wikilink"), the aquatic Nyad takes the
form of a stunning [elven](Elves "wikilink") woman with long green hair.
She notices you watching her and says, "In the name of the [High
Sylph](High_Sylph "wikilink") I require your assistance. If you would
prove yourself trustworthy, return to me [my wreath of water
lilies](Wreath_Of_Water_Lilies "wikilink"). It was stolen by one of the
[elves](Elves "wikilink") in these foothills. I worry that it may fall
into the claws of the driders within [the
Volcano](:Category:_Lloth's_Peak "wikilink"), who could use it as a
magical focus to destroy me."*
