Each [object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") pops with a certain
level or, most often, within a certain range of levels. When a
[mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") respawns with
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") on it, their levels will
each be between one less and one more than its
[level](Level.md "wikilink").
[Ammunition](:Category:_Ammunition.md "wikilink") is a notable exception
to this rule, as it will always be of one specific level determined by
its [warhead type](:Category:_Warhead_Types.md "wikilink").

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may
[save](Save.md "wikilink") with
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") up to 7 levels above their
[level](Level.md "wikilink").

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may
[wield](Wield.md "wikilink") [weapons](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink")
up to 5 levels above their [level](Level.md "wikilink").

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may
[wear](Wear.md "wikilink") other [gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink")
up to 3 levels above their [level](Level.md "wikilink").

A piece of [armor](:Category:_Armor.md "wikilink")'s level determines
its [base armor class](Armor_Values.md "wikilink").
