or, most often, within a certain range of levels. When a

be between one less and one more than its [level](Level "wikilink").

this rule, as it will always be of one specific level determined by its
[warhead type](:Category:_Warhead_Types "wikilink").

[save](Save "wikilink") with [objects](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") up

[wield](Wield "wikilink") [weapons](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") up to
5 levels above their [level](Level "wikilink").

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may
[wear](Wear "wikilink") other [gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") up to 3
levels above their [level](Level "wikilink").
