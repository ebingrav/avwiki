Each [object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") has a specific "quality"
analagous to a [characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink")' [hit
points](Hit_Points.md "wikilink"), including both current and maximum
amounts that are initially equal.
[Objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") may lose their current hit
points by various means, most often by being damaged by certain
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") during combat, but, unless
they are destroyed, they may be either [smithed](Smith.md "wikilink") or
[repaired](Repair.md "wikilink"). Also, some
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") give
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")
[flags](:Category:_Object_Flags.md "wikilink") that protect them from
certain kinds of [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") damage.
[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may see an
[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")'s quality by
[identifying](Identify.md "wikilink") it; also, all those who
[practice](Practice.md "wikilink") both [armor
lore](Armor_Lore.md "wikilink") and [weapon
lore](Weapon_Lore.md "wikilink") may see roughly how damaged most
[objects](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") are by toggling
[condition](Condition.md "wikilink") on and then looking at them.
