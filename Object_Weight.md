Each [object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") has a specific weight,
which is significant because each
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") has a certain [carrying
capacity](Carrying_Capacity.md "wikilink") that limits how much total
weight he/she/it may carry at one time. An
[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")'s weight may also affect its
capacity to be used as a [telekinetic
weapon](:Category:_Telekinetic_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink"), as well
as how much damage it will do if and when it is used as such.
