*Peering through yellow eyes with oval pupils, the shaman gazes
thoughtfully at you. She seems to be looking at and through you at the
same time. Except for the almost reptile like eyes, she appears
[human](Human.md "wikilink"), though bent by age. Her soft buffalo robes
are plain but decorated by beads and mystic symbols. "Welcome to my
cave. I am Odertha, shaman and only living member of the Qass. My clan
has lived here on the [Qanza
Prairie](:Category:_Qanza_Prairie.md "wikilink") for many generations.
Many moons ago, we were camped just outside the Great Rock Spires. Then
a great rock fell from the sky, striking the heart of the Spires. All of
my kin within the Spires were slain at once, but their spirits were
trapped within the rocks. The rock also brought a great plague to those
camped outside the Spires. I was here at the time, and was spared, but
all the rest of my kin died quick, horrible deaths." "We once worshipped
within the Spires. We worked hard to expose the ancients frozen within
the rocks, so that their beauty could be seen by all. Now all our hard
work has been for naught. The spirits of my clan haunt the Rocks, unable
to find peace because of the aura of the sky stone. I have finally
neutralized the plague the stone carries, but my power is not great
enough to free my kin. Please help those you can to find rest. It is too
late for some, but I know that several can still be freed."*
