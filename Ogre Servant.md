*Filthy, tired, irritated, this ogre is doing all the chores for
Mistress Mach. Running errands, he mutters under his breath how he
wishes he was with his brethren, ravaging and plundering, burning and
raping. Instead he is stuck cleaning up behind his pack, and the nasty
trolls. He spits in anger, but starts cleaning it up right away, afraid
that Tannah might have seen him and will petrify him.*
