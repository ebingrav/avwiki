*"Self-important [elves](Elves.md "wikilink")!" A great
[ogre](Ogres.md "wikilink") mumbles more loudly than one might expect.
"If only I weren't surrounded by mindless [trolls](Trolls.md "wikilink")
and barren wastes. I'd raise an army and loot the treasures of that wood
myself." A pause. His eyes gleam with excitement and hunger as they fall
upon your tasty bones. "Isn't this a treat," the
[ogre](Ogres.md "wikilink") muses. "I've not fed upon such marrow in
days! But wait, what notion of your mind does your countenance betray?
You'd bargain for your life, but what have you to offer me?" His face
grows dark and ominous as his jagged teeth begin to peer from behind his
accursed lips; a smile? "Go to Avalon. There, in the rubble of glass,
crystal and gold, you must locate a stone. Although worthless to most,
this gem is vital to the research of many scholars. Retrieve it and
return it to me and I shall compensate you with more than just your
life."*
