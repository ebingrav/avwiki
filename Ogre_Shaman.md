**(Flying) (Demonic) (Black Aura) Dressed in colorful robes, a powerful
ogre wills herself off the floor.**

*The shaman is one of Mistress Mach's most senior minions, much to the
chagrin of the rest of her underlings. She often plays cruel tricks on
the trolls, whom she sees as lesser creatures, and epecially enjoys
their fear-stricken faces whenever they catch sight of her. The air
hisses and whirls about the shaman's floating body as she divines
sources of power for her mistress to plunder.*
