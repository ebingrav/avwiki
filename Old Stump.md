A heavily scarred and frankly rather worrying ent eyes you.

With so many scars, you would be forgiven for believing that this ent
was a berserker, but in fact he is simply a ranger who has got into far
too many scraps in his time and famously, at least one forest fire. He
might be ugly to look at, but that is just the way he likes it when he
is bearing down on an orc raiding party armed with axes, a vision from
their worst nightmares. Old Stump is in perfect health.

Old Stump is using:

<worn about waist>`  [Pristine  ] tendrils of ivy`  
<wielded>`           [Pristine  ] a knobkerrie`
