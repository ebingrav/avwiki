*Rust lines the sword, as if Yorimandil long ago gave up trying to keep
it in good condition. Rumor says he allows his weapon to atrophy to keep
his fights interesting. Under the dirt, it seems to be made of blood
mithril. Perhaps a skilled smith with sufficient raw material could
restore it.*

`It is a double weapon which does slicing damage.`
