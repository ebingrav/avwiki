*I am writing this because I fear I will never leave [this
place](:Category:_Catacombs_Of_Solace "wikilink") as a mortal man. It
started slowly as one by one members of my crew disappeared. We could
hear their voices but could never find them. Eventually only I was left.
I could hear them screaming for help all around me and I swear I could
even feel them pulling at my clothing as I ran for the exit. When I
reached the ladder out, I found that no matter how long I climbed I
never reached the top... Even now, despite my cries for help, they are
boarding up the entrance to this cellar. I know not when another living
soul will set foot in these chambers. Surely I will not live much
longer. Whatever force is here, the
[priests](:Category:_Priests "wikilink") have not contained it, and I
can feel it wasting away at my flesh. I fear I will be long gone when
the day comes, but I would be grateful if the one who finds this note
would try and pass word of my fate to my descendents so that they know I
did not abandon them by choice. When I began work here, my son had just
left home to study with the [priests](:Category:_Priests "wikilink") to
become a [healer](:Category:_Healers "wikilink"). I am sure that he will
have succeeded, and likely passed the trade on to his children. He
always swore to me that he was destined to begin a great line of
[healers](:Category:_Healers "wikilink") who would serve this new town
and all young adventurers in need of help. If he succeeded... if indeed
there is a great [healer](:Category:_Healers "wikilink") nearby, please
pass on this message so that my family knows I never stopped trying to
return home.*
