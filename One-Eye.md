*One-Eye has admired Fay from afar ever since seeing her in a tavern
during a visit to Mervue during shore leave many moons ago. Rebuked by
Fay as a penniless drunkard, yet undeterred, he followed rumours of her
to Solace and recently took service as a helper to the Orphanage cook,
to be near her. He still harbours hopes to convince Matron Fay of his
suit and is determined to win her affections for himself. Unbeknown to
Fay, One-Eye is in fact a wealthy man, from his years pirating upon the
high seas.*
