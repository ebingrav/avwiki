*His task, as given to him by Veyah, is to destroy all intruders who
would dare come into this sacred place. He has done a good job so far,
he believes, but he suspects several of the guards as being possible
deserters down the road. But he needs more evidence than just his
hunches before he hands the names over to his mistress, otherwise she
would have HIS head on a pike, and not theirs. So he is fighting for the
most precious thing any being can fight for: a life... his own.*

## Comments

This mob appears after you kill one of the [High Drow
children](High_Drow_Child.md "wikilink") (the fifth one listed - scan
description says it's overcome with emotion). The spy is aggie and
stabs.
