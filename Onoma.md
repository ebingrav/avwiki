Syntax: cast onoma <object> <rename>

A Lord that has learned this spell can cast Onoma upon his possessions
with a new, more appropriate name. With the magic word, onoma, the Psi
can bend the name to a new one.

If the name is determined to be out of theme or objectionable, you are
liable to invoke the wrath of the Gods. Lines of poetry or strings of
ASCII symbols are not acceptable renames. As a guideline, use items
currently available in the mud's areas. Failure to use common sense when
renaming can result in the object being destroyed or possibly more
severe penalties.

The Immortals will always be aware when you use this power. There is a
limit of 72 characters for the line length. This includes characters
used for color.
