*This globe of light seems to be in constant flux, changing its shape
rapidly and never settling on just one. If you watch it long enough, you
notice it runs the gamut of geometric shapes, from a circle to a square
to a triangle and so on. The chaos within this small orb must be
literally unfathomable.*

## Comments

Although this is a weapon, it is used in the held slot. Hence, it can be
enchanted with Enchant Weapon to give even more hitroll/damroll as long
as the level does not go above 54. Also, since one does not attack with
it, the base weapon values are not important. It also can be runed (See:
Rune) for -15ac.

As it can pop at a lower level some people prefer to fodder this rather
than the [Shard Of Black Doom
Marble](Shard_Of_Black_Doom_Marble "wikilink").

The highest an orb can go, naturally, is to 12/12.
