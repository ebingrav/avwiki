*Tall, lanky and dirty, this orc comes from the abandoned vineyards to
the east. This particular band of orcs is rather brutal and ruthless,
perhaps made more aggressive by the tainted land around them in the
vineyards. They've taken upon raiding the farmlands off on the other
side of the river, and are making easy work of the small group of guards
that stand in their way most of the time.*
