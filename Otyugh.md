*Otyughs, or gulguthra, devour the waste and live on the decay of Life.
It stands on three stocky legs that inhibit its movement. The eye stalk
is a receiver and transmitter for all psionic abilities and also
supports three other large eyes. This otyugh has an unusually large
mouth and brittle teeth in the center of his mouth, allowing it to
swallow you whole. Two tentacles with leaf-like ridges are at its sides
for grappling and smashing. The tentacles are covered with thorn-like
projections for extra damage. This disgusting creature is a fierce
disease-ridden beast, and moves to you in hopes of devouring your life
source and thriving off of your decaying corpse!*
