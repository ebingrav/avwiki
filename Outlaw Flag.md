*OUTLAW is what happens when you commit a crime in a [lawful
city](:Category:_Lawful_Areas "wikilink"). Examples of such crimes would
be [attacking](Kill "wikilink") royalty, trying to
[steal](Steal "wikilink") (unsuccessfully) from a
[shopkeeper](:Category:_Shopkeepers "wikilink"), or annoying a
[townguard](Townguard_Mobs "wikilink"). When you become an outlaw, the
[citizens](Citizen_Mobs "wikilink") of a [lawful
city](:Category:_Lawful_Areas "wikilink") will not like you any more.
The [guards](Townguard_Mobs "wikilink") of [lawful
cities](:Category:_Lawful_Areas "wikilink") will attempt to
[apprehend](Arrests "wikilink") you and take you to
[jail](Jail_Rooms "wikilink")! If you get [arrested](Arrests "wikilink")
and taken to [jail](Jail_Rooms "wikilink"), you must pay a fine (or
maybe worse) as penance for your offenses.*
