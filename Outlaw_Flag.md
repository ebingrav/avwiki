*OUTLAW is what happens when you commit a crime in a [lawful
city](:Category:_Lawful_Areas.md "wikilink"). Examples of such crimes
would be [attacking](Kill.md "wikilink") royalty, trying to
[steal](Steal.md "wikilink") (unsuccessfully) from a
[shopkeeper](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink"), or annoying a
[townguard](Townguard_Mobs.md "wikilink"). When you become an outlaw,
the [citizens](Citizen_Mobs.md "wikilink") of a [lawful
city](:Category:_Lawful_Areas.md "wikilink") will not like you any more.
The [guards](Townguard_Mobs.md "wikilink") of [lawful
cities](:Category:_Lawful_Areas.md "wikilink") will attempt to
[apprehend](Arrests.md "wikilink") you and take you to
[jail](Jail_Rooms.md "wikilink")! If you get
[arrested](Arrests.md "wikilink") and taken to
[jail](Jail_Rooms.md "wikilink"), you must pay a fine (or maybe worse)
as penance for your offenses.*
