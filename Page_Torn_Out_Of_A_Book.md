*Two of the four edges of this small piece of paper are lined in gold
foil. The penmanship looks like
[Chalmus'](Chalmus_The_Alchemist.md "wikilink"), except that it is
jagged and wild. Whoever wrote this was either excited or in a hurry
when they did so. It reads as follows:*

*Once more I'm free to prowl the night. That old magus tries to keep me
subdued, but even his stalwart mind can't stand watch all the time. I
wait patiently day in and day out for his concentration to lapse, and
when it does I am reborn. None of those fools understand my power or my
brilliance, but I've stopped caring. I'll see to it that they are
slaughtered like the animals they are...but not before they are made to
suffer in a living hell of my own design. Their terror fuels my power. I
revel in my own wickedness.*
