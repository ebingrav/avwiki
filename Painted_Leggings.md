*Here you see a set of leggings which have had an image painted on them.
The image you see is that of a great conflict. Down the left let you see
a giant army rushing across a large open plain. In the army you see many
small warriors mounted upon catoblepas. On the right leg you see a scene
of mass destruction. There are many slain bodies and standing above them
all is an image of a large half-orc paladin.*
