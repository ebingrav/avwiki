*No one is certain of the origin of the unearthly forge located within
the Hall of Paladins. What is known however, is that the unique
quicksilver weapons forged from it are unlike any other. In addition to
their near perfect quality, these weapons can be blessed with further
enhancements.*

*As the Paladin grows in stature and earn blessings from their crusades
and quests, they will gain the ability to add different enhancements to
their weapons.*

*While a Paladin may only own one of these weapons at any given time,
they can chose to replace it or have a new weapon made, should their
current weapon be lost. No one other than the Paladin can handle these
weapons which are bound to the very fabric of their owner's being.*

*Aleryia, the Paladin Guild Weaponsmith, is in charge of crafting
weapons for the most worthy of Paladins.*

Multiple clears of the area might be necessary to gain credit (try clearing all the mobs on the downward path towards the tainted mobs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Redemption   | Hero 250        | Amplifies heals cast on the paladin (adds 10% to the heal amount).                                        | Given by Torrak. Unlocked by killing [Arcanthra](Arcanthra_The_Black "wikilink"), returning the dropped note, and then killing [Crullius The White](Crullius_The_White "wikilink") and returning his dagger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Sylvan       | Hero 500        | Increase damage against faerie races (+15%) and protection from Faerie races (+5%).                       | Multi-step quest at the archaeologist in [Graves of Reveria](:Category:Graves_Of_Reveria "wikilink"). Once you find him, you must slay a magical presence in [Necropolis](:Category:Necropolis "wikilink"), and return his trinket. Then you must scour the mausoleum in [Graves of Reveria](:Category:Graves_Of_Reveria "wikilink") for a hidden treasure. Finally, you must single-handedly defend the archaeologist from an onslaught of wraiths. Please note that this quest should not be attempted by more than one paladin at a time, as the archaeologist changes states between turnins, and quest completion will reset him to his initial form. If the final leg of the quest is failed, it cannot be attempted again until the next day. There is also a bug where "a magical presence" does not properly spawn the quest item it should be carrying; if this occurs it should be fixed on repop, or by fleeing and re-attempting the mob. |
| Steadfast    | Hero 750        | Protection from stun. (+20% for Lord)                                                                     | Multi-step quest. You must slay an undetermined number of ronin in [Shogun](Shogun "wikilink") as well as striking the killing blow against [Shogun Senjisama](Shogun_Senjisama "wikilink"). Once you have completed this task you will get a lotus petal to present to the [True Emperor](True_Emperor "wikilink") who will follow you to [Pansho](Pansho "wikilink"). Helping him in this escape will complete the task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Clear gith tower, then kill mage at top, he opens portal. (Don't kill mage first, or clearing the tower won't count.) Enter portal and kill commander (not soloable; N.B. soloed pretty handily with a High Elf. Difficulty is largely due to mindbender spells everywhere. Pray for deflection and let most of your damage come from ripostes, clear out a few lancers and swordsmen before engaging the boss to reduce the likelihood of a walkin. You can outheal the commander's damage while it's a 1v1).
