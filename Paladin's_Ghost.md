*The elder son of the Keep's master, his heart was pure enough to escape
the wrath of the Curse. He fled to this chamber and hid from his
brother's anger. Devoting his remaining energies to sealing the rift
between the Realms, he now stands watch over the barrier. He nods
solemnly to you and whispers, 'Be at peace...'*

## Comments

The mob is northwest in the Shadow Keep area; the quickest pp is simply
"rot cor", then go follow the linear path nw. The mob was recently
(October 2010) revamped, to make him considerably harder. For one thing,
he is now a sorcerer (in flat contradiction to his alignment), meaning
he casts vampire touch throughout the fight and heals himself with your
hp; secondly, he is much more resistant and will take longer to kill.
Prepare for a good fight, and have at least 2500 mana available.
