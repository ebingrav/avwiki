*No one is certain of the origin of the unearthly forge located within
the Hall of Paladins. What is known however, is that the unique
quicksilver weapons forged from it are unlike any other. In addition to
their near perfect quality, these weapons can be blessed with further
enhancements.*

*As the Paladin grows in stature and earn blessings from their crusades
and quests, they will gain the ability to add different enhancements to
their weapons.*

*While a Paladin may only own one of these weapons at any given time,
they can chose to replace it or have a new weapon made, should their
current weapon be lost. No one other than the Paladin can handle these
weapons which are bound to the very fabric of their owner's being.*

*Aleryia, the Paladin Guild Weaponsmith, is in charge of crafting
weapons for the most worthy of Paladins.*
