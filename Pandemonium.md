*Churning and turbulent are the winds of Chaos. After vowing to the
entropic whims of their deity, a Paladin can use the aid of erratic
misperception to cause a universe of trouble on the battlefield. In
essence, the paths of reason and random are twisted, bent, crossed,
squeezed, stretched and torn causing waves of irregular ripples to tear
the victims' sense of reality into a whole new realm of confusion. Use
of this spell can cause as much chaos and damage within your own ranks
as in the opposing force.*

*An active Oath of Chaos is required to use this spell.*
