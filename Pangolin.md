*Is it an aardvark? No... An anteater? Not exactly... An armadillo...
Almost. It is a pangolin. She is about two feet long and covered in
horny scales. She waddles from anthill to anthill snatching up the
little insects with her foot long tongue. It is an amazing sight to
watch as she makes quick work of an anthill with her small claws and
then fires off a stick thin pink tongue into the resulting hole. It
would almost look cute if the tongue was not full of squirming red ants
that keep leaping into its mouth. Oh, and that musty smell...*
