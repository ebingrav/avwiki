*Papio is the chief of the baboons who now rule the Sableroix estate. He
is probably one of the largest baboons to ever live. He stands almost
ten feet tall on the top of legs the size of tree trunks. His long
muscular arms reach all the way down to his knees. His eyes are red and
angry that something has trespassed on his domain. He stretches his huge
arms out, arching his back, and screaming a deafening warcry to show all
intruders that he is the boss and not to be trifled with.*
