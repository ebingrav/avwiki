Syntax: cast pardon

This spell was originally devised by Paean class Priests as a way to end
conflict and hatred without bloodshed. It is also often taught to
Paladins of Tul-Sith, who, as their Church's Generals, are also
sometimes called on to mediate peace talks.

The spell affects all mobs in the same area, who are hunting a player,
not currently fighting, and not in the same room as their target. The
outcome depends on the victims' alignments. Relatively good hunters will
be compelled to grant their prey clemency, but that is not the only
possible outcome.

The Pardon spell will work successfully only once on any single mob in
its lifetime.
