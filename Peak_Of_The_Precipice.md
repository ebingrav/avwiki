Located 2 Up from a southwest corner on the Mesa in Cinderheim, this is
the lloydable room for the area and serves as an effective way to bypass
the dangerous set of mobs that guards the entrace to the area.
Occasionally a mob will wander into this room, but it's rare - however,
there is always the dragon in the room which is moderately sized, but
not a difficult mob to shift into by any means. There is also a fountain
in this room which casts sanctuary on evil aligned characters. An
excellent regen spot for a group in Cinderheim and a good spot for those
looking to set anchor for EXP purposes as you can stay in Cinderheim -
normally a difficult area for smaller groups to enter, or portal out to
proper.
