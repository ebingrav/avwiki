*This demon feeds on the dark forces that are released by hate, anger
and fear. Wherever there is strife he thrives! Out of his cat-like head
two dark unblinking eyes stare at you. Instead of arms he has tentacles
growing out of his sides that seem to move constantly and are slowly
making their way towards you.*
