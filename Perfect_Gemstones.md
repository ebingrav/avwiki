## Hero

Hero mobs can sometimes drop hero-level perfect gems when they die. The
group of players usually needs to be at least five in size (though has
been known to occur with four) and the mobs need to be at least level 80
(with higher levels having a higher chance). Some example areas are
[Alpha Thule](Alpha_Thule "wikilink"), and certain mobs in [ Exploration
Outpost](:Category:_Exploration_Outpost "wikilink") and [ The Great
Divide](Great_Divide "wikilink").

## Lord

Lord mobs have a SLIM chance to load perfect gemstones on the ground
when they die. In order to qualify, the mob must be level 150+, and
there must be 5+ lords in the group. 200+ mobs have higher odds.

Which gemtype is determined by the plane. Nowhere, midgaardia, hell,
imm, angel, arena, legend and thorngate planes do not generate stones.

Here's a list of what gems you can expect to find on each of the outer
planes
