*This [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") summons a wandering
pillar of flame onto the battlefield. Every
[round](Rounds.md "wikilink"), on his turn, the caster controls the
pillar instead of taking his melee attacks. This control is limited to
keeping the pillar from scorching the caster or his allies, as the
pillar will burn who it pleases. This is a SUSTAINED DAMAGE-OVER-TIME
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink"). Any
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"), movement or attack will
cause the caster to lose the [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink")
before its 5 tick duration is complete. The
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") does not end when combat ends.
If there are no targets, the pillar will meander about, happily
scorching the ground and nearby plants until the caster dismisses it.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'pillar of flame'.
