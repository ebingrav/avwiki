*This [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") summons a wandering pillar
of flame onto the battlefield. Every [round](Rounds "wikilink"), on his
turn, the caster controls the pillar instead of taking his melee
attacks. This control is limited to keeping the pillar from scorching
the caster or his allies, as the pillar will burn who it pleases. This
is a SUSTAINED DAMAGE-OVER-TIME [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink").
Any [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"), movement or attack will
cause the caster to lose the [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink")
before its 5 tick duration is complete. The
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") does not end when combat ends. If
there are no targets, the pillar will meander about, happily scorching
the ground and nearby plants until the caster dismisses it.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'pillar of flame'.
