*There is only one known object in the universe that can be planeshifted
directly to... that is the Planar Anchor. It is a golden artifact of
extreme unknown power able to warp space and time. It does not care
where in the universe it rests, so a Psion somewhere found a way to draw
it forth for a brief period of time to a location.*

*The Planar Anchor can only be pulled to a Lloydable room. The Anchor is
unique. Only one can exist in the universe at any given time. When it is
not pulled, it is in Limbo and unreachable.*

*Casting planar anchor without an argument will search the outer planes
for the artifact and inform you where it currently is (room name only).*

*Summoning the anchor requires the use of the "summon" argument.*

You must have 5 casters with a Psi/Mnd among them in order to summon the
anchor. It can only be cast in [Lloydable
Rooms](Lloydable_Rooms "wikilink").  
"c planar" - find out where the anchor is located  
"c planar summon" - summon the anchor
