` "If it's so cold why does it feel so hot?!"`  
` - Dying thoughts of Archfiend Antillian`

*Lordly mages earn the ability to summon a deadly ray of impossibly cold
to penetrate even the sturdiest of creatures from the outer planes.*

*In addition to the damage inflicted targetsmay also find themselves
less capable in their own attempts to inflict melee damage.*

This spell causes **cold and water damage.**
