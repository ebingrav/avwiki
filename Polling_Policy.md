*Polling people means to ask a question of many people. Polling on a MUD
typically means you want something. Polling other players is allowed but
it is socially unaccepted by most people. If you don't care what the
player community thinks, by all means poll until nobody helps you
anymore.*

*Polling [IMMs](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink"), however, for favors
or alternative judgment is Illegal.
[Immortals](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink") maintain a professional
ethic of continuity which is enforced by the staff. If you don't like
what Immortal-A gave you as a punishment for swearing on channels, your
only acceptable recourse is to email: <appeals@outland.org>.*

*Asking for alternative judgment from other
[IMMs](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink"), however, will get you into
more trouble than it is worth.*
