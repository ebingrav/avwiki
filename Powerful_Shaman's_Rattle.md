*The rattle seems to be made of some kind of bone. It is very old and
brittle. Carvings of animals and spirits dance around the middle of the
rattle. Feathers and strands of hair are attached to the top and bottom
of the rattle with leather strips that have been dried and cured. There
is a soft humming noise surrounding the rattle. You begin to worry for
your soul.*
