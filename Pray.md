    Any player may send to the prayer channel, but only Angels and Immortals
    can hear it.  The prayer channel may be used to communicate with the Angels
    and to call for help in emergency situations (if you are drowning, for
    instance).  However, please refrain from frivolous spamming of this
    channel, as it is a vital source of information for some people.  If there
    are no Angels on, it is probably best to direct such requests to the
    heroes.

    The shortkey for the Angel channel is '^'.  'Pray' also works.

As it is an emergency channel, feel free to make your messages short.  
Beware though - don't make them so short the angel or immortal has  
trouble understanding them, or you might die while they figure it out!  
For example:

-   pray -hp
-   pray drowning
-   pray I can't find my corpse

If you have typed the command correctly, you will see the line:

  
  
Your soul searches for an angel...
