*The President spent ten years as an apprentice gem cutter, followed by
forty years as an acknowledged master of his trade before becoming the
president of the Miners and Gem Cutters guild. Yet for all his time in
the trade, he is resented by the powerful miners faction. Like most
[dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink"), he enjoys a good argument, but the recent
bickering is wearing even his patience a little thin.*
