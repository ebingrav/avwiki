From [frightened goblin](Frightened_Goblin.md "wikilink"):

-   Find [A goblin jailer](Goblin_Jailer.md "wikilink") and dispose of
    him.
-   [Get](Get.md "wikilink") [a small, crude
    key](Small,_Crude_Key.md "wikilink") from his corpse.
-   Find [A prisoner of the
    goblins](Prisoner_Of_The_Goblins.md "wikilink") and give it to him
    in order to begin the quest proper.

You can lead the prisoner to:

1.  Safety at the [Meadow](:Category:Meadow.md "wikilink") entrance, and
    receive 300 gold,
2.  Locate the key to *The Treasure Room Of The Great Goblin* (it's on
    one of the roaming guards) then walk to the Treasure Room Of The
    Great Goblin and the prisoner will reward you with a [silver
    beacon](Silver_Beacon.md "wikilink"),
3.  The room before the [Valley Of The
    Dogs](:Category:Valley_Of_The_Dogs.md "wikilink"), reward is a
    [mithril rod](Mithril_Rod.md "wikilink"),
4.  The exit onto the River Tunnels, and then all the way to the *A
    Watery Pit* and receive a ... somewhat less satisfactory conclusion.
