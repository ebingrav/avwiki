*Held together by her sorcerer's magic, Veyah is able to travel back and
forth from this place and her current hiding place on another plane. The
space around the projection crackles and hisses as she gets weaker and
stronger with each breath. Her body is distorted and awkward like a
wooden block, but her eyes are full of life and follow the slightest
movement around the room.  
*Although she regrets the ability to be fully in both places at once, at
least this way she can keep the dissenters at bay and her ruling power
strong. But it has been a long time since she has set foot out of this
room, and a long time since she has seen anything beyond the corners of
these walls.''
