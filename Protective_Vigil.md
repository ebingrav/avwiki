**Syntax: cast 'protective vigil**'

*The clerics of Gorn are well known for their stern demeanour and
powerful protective spells. Protective vigil is the spell they developed
as a last line of protection against incoming damage. This aura will
reduce by a portion all the incoming damage that is ultimately taken.*

*This is a powerful pantheon spell. Any single cleric can only maintain
(i.e. be the caster of) one of these spells at any given time.*
