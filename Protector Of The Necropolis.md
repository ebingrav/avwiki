*Something has made this protector upset, an occurrence he cannot scrub
from his mind. He does not speak, but his steps are brisk, and he stomps
through the icy slush rather than walk quietly, not caring the amount of
dirtied ice that lands on the walls before sliding back down after a few
seconds. It doesn't matter how far he walks, or for how long, as the
memory will always be there waiting for him around the next bend. None
of the guards of this area are ever allowed down into the inner sanctum
below this, but he was curious, a bit sickened by the screams he heard
tearing through the air every few hours. And so he looked, cautiously
tiptoeing along the stairs and holding onto the railing lest he fall and
announce his presence.*
