*This person has one job, and one job only; she must guard the bones of
someone who died long ago and cannot possibly care what happens anymore.
At least that's how she sees it: her job is meaningless, as she was
stationed here long after the tomb was initially vandalized and there is
nothing left of value for her to guard. She has heard rumors of a
hideous curse that the mistress cast on those who tried to flee her
grasp, that those who were afflicted screamed in agony for weeks until
their voices died, their souls not far behind.*
