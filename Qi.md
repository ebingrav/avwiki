QI syntax:

         qi
      or qi show

Qi is a mystical force that permeates the Planescape. Only highly
advanced (Lord+) Monks and Shadowfists have discovered how to manipulate
and control Qi through self-discipline and mastery of their own bodies.

Such practioners distinguish between two types of Qi. Inner Qi remains
focused within one's own body. It is built up through the mindful use of
certain martial abilities (listed below).

Outer Qi can be focused onto others with truly powerful results. It is
built up through the use of Inner Qi.

The maximum amount of Qi that you can store is dictated by your Wisdom.
Typing qi with no arguments will show you all the Qi-related abilities
that you have access to. Typing qi show will show you have much Inner
and Outer Qi you have accumulated. Prompt symbols also exist to help you
keep track of your Inner & Outer Qi. See HELP PROMPT for more info.

Qi is meant to be built up through active gameplay. As such, counter-
attacks do not yield Qi, and you cannot save your Qi when you log out.
Accumulated Qi naturally degrades over time if you do not use it.

Abilities that yield Inner Qi include kick, rescue, trip, toss, shatter
strike, and [chakra](chakra "wikilink") strike.
