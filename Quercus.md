*This old ent remembers fighting in the last ent-giant war, and the
things he saw still haunt him millennia later. The scars he bears on his
trunk are nothing compared to those he bears on his soul, and since then
he has retired to the Heartwood and not left. A life of contemplation
and serving the divine brings him some measure of peace, even as does
the forest itself.*

**Level:** 95  
**Description:** *A gnarled old ent wanders, lost in thought.*
