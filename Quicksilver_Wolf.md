*One of the greatest creations of the geomancer, this large wolf
consists entirely out of mercury, also known as quicksilver.  
Cold eyes, also mercury, glare at you and her ears are pressed flat
against the back of her wicked looking head.  
With her fangs displayed the wolf slowly goes into a crouching stance,
getting ready to jump you, and rip out your jugular.*

## Comments

There are a few different versions of this creature - most notably one
in [Daingean Machadae](:Category:_Daingean_Machadae "wikilink") and some
others in [Helikon Tower](:Category:_Helikon_Tower "wikilink"). While of
slightly different levels, they are ALL corpse eaters, and all roam if
given the chance. Only the one in Daingean Machadae sneaks or hides.
Otherwise, they are identical.
