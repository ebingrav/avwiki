*You stare in the cold and cruel eyes of a young yet large wolf. Its
lips slowly curl back and his long fangs are bared. However, this is no
normal wolf. Its skin ripples and gives a metallic shine, as it appears
to be made of mercury! Its big muscular paws stick to the vertical
obsidian surface, enabling it to crouch down, ready to spring at your
throat.*
