*Races with a strong connection to the elements can attempt to align
themselves to a specific element to gain access to additional abilities.
The available elements are fire, air, water and earth. You may not align
to more than one element at once.*

Syntax: racial align <element>

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a time when used.

The abilities granted by racial-align are a bit different than the
racials of the [hero-level elemental type](:Category:Imps "wikilink").
Align water and align earth are most often used, though air is uniquely
capable of disabling pesky caster mobs. Racial align will augment the
damage type of melee attacks with the current element, similar to

[burn](Racial_Burn "wikilink") [fireaura](Racial_Fireaura "wikilink")
