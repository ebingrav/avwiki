*Certain creatures have inherently unstable natural forms. This runs
contrary to the norm for most other beings resulting in healing spells
being far less effective on these amorphous beings.*

*If a creature with this trait is able shapechange into a more stable
form it will effectively circumvent this restriction so long as it
maintains the new form.*
