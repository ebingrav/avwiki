''Races born in or imbued with the elemental power of water will find
certain benefits within their native element. They possess an innate
freedom of movement while on or under water. Their attacks will have a
higher chance of success and do slightly more damage, while enemy blows
are more easily evaded and do less harm.

''The effects of this racial are automatic.

## Comments

This racial functions as an additional racial damage mod if you are
currently in a water room. Practically, this means blue dragons or imps
(or any other race possessing this racial) in water plane can hit
significantly harder than virtually any other race, in a manner
comparable to lord 500 fdks. This is less good than it sounds, since
water is rarely run, but it makes for some pretty assassinates. This
also works in other watery environments.
