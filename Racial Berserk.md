*A [race](:Category:_Races "wikilink") prone to berserking has the
potential to become enraged when hurt, raising [damage
roll](Damage_Roll "wikilink") at the expense of [armor
class](Armor_Class "wikilink"). Several different levels of rage are
possible, depending on how frequently the
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") is hurt. The
[calm](Calm "wikilink") and [awe](Awe "wikilink")
[spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") can slow the effects of berserk,
and the [frenzy](Frenzy "wikilink")
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") will exacerbate them.*
