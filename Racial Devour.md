''Red Dragons have truly voracious appetites. They have been known to
devour their foes whole when the mood strikes them.

''Upon successfully devouring a worthy foe, the Red Dragon may find
themselves temporarily more adept at fighting, casting offensive spells,
or healing. Which advantage the Dragon experiences depends on the former
occupation of their meal.

''Despite their renowned appetite, a Red Dragon is unable to devour
whole a victim that is too powerful or too large for them.

''Typing racial devour with no target attacks a mob you are already in
combat with. This racial is EXHAUSTED for a long time when used.

Syntax: racial devour <target>  
or racial devour
