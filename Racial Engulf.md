''As a Blue Dragon, you can summon a bubble of Elemental Water around
one of your foes. This causes your enemy to begin drowning.

''The mobs of our world cannot drown to death, but while drowning they
are in a more vulnerable position. This causes the next melee attack to
land upon them for considerably more damage. While your enemy struggles
to breathe, they will also be unable to cast any spell that requires an
incantation.

''This ability can only be used if you're not already underwater. It has
no affect on enemies that can breathe water.

''Typing racial engulf with no target attacks a mob you are already in
combat with. This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

Syntax: racial engulf <target>  
or racial engulf
