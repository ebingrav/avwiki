Syntax: racial evaporate

Races with a strong connection to the element of air can turn themselves
to vapor for a short time, allowing them to escape danger. Users will
immediately drift to a nearby room which doesn't contain enemies.

This racial is only available to users who ALIGN or have an innate
connection to the element of air.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This racial is of extremely rare utility, as in most lord wipe
situations you will already have aligned to something more useful.
However, it can still be incorporated into a planeshift alias for escape
attempts.
