*A [race](:Category:_Races "wikilink") with this curse is innately evil,
and their [alignment](Alignment "wikilink") will tend to edge in that
direction. It is possible for extremely well behaved evil
[races](:Category:_Races "wikilink") to achieve neutrality, and even
good [alignment](Alignment "wikilink"), but it's going to take a lot
more fighting evil than it normally would.*
