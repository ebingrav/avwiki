1 HURL 'RACIAL HURL' RACIAL-HURL Syntax: racial hurl <target> or racial
hurl

Stone Giants have a nasty habit of hurling boulders around when they're
trying to make a point. When you use this ability, you will hurl the
first available item in your inventory at your enemy. Heavier objects do
more damage, but you cannot hurl corpses or containers. Typing 'racial
hurl' with no target attacks a mob you are already in combat with.

The maximum weight that you can hurl is the same as the maximum weight
that you can wield. See the ABILITIES screen for this number. It is
determined by your current STRENGTH.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.
