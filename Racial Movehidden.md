*This [racial ability](:Category:_Racials "wikilink") functions exactly
like the [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") for which it is named.
Like most [racials](:Category:_Racials "wikilink"), it requires rest
between uses.*

Syntax: racial movehidden.

## Comments

Gives movehidden for 24 ticks on a 8-10 tick cooldown. Unlike the skill,
racial movehidden can be activated any time, including during combat.
Also the racial versions of [sneak](Racial_Sneak "wikilink") and
movehidden are supposedly slightly more effective ("sneakier") than the
corresponding skills.
