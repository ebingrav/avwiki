''Certain stocky races excel at using their bulk to more easily handle
large, heavy weapons. The powerswing racial increases your chances of
using [2nd attack](Second_Attack "wikilink") (and similar skills) while
wielding [2-handed
weapons](:Category:Standard_Two-Handed_Weapons "wikilink").

''This bonus only applies to specifically 2-handed weapons, not weapons
which require 2 hands but, have a different description, such as
[spears](:Category:Hafted_Weapons "wikilink"),
[bows](:Category:Bows "wikilink") and
[chains](:Category:Chain_Weapons "wikilink").

## Confused?

To determine whether or not a weapon is affected by **Racial
Powerswing**, simply [Examine](Examine "wikilink") it while trained in
[Weapon Lore](Weapon_Lore "wikilink"). To gain the benefits of Racial
Powerswing, you want to see the following in the Examine output:

`It is a two handed weapon which does (type) damage.`

If this instead reads "is a
[hafted](:Category:Hafted_Weapons "wikilink") weapon" or "is a
[double](Double_Hit "wikilink") weapon", you will not gain the benefits
of **Racial Powerswing**.
