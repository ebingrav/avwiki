Syntax: racial shelter

Races with a strong connection to the element of earth can summon a
stone shelter, blocking all entry to and exit from the user's current
room for a short time. Summoning the shelter requires intense
concentration, so the user cannot activate it during combat. In
addition, the shelter cannot be summoned in the air or in water.

This racial is only available to users who ALIGN or have an innate
connection to the element of earth.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

## Comments

This extremely useful racial will prevent walkins for a period of time
in every direction, basically a deluxe wall of thorns spell. It is
especially valuable when camping gear runs. The exhause on this is very
long, about 48 tics.
