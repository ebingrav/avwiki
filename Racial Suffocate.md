Syntax: racial suffocate <target>

This racial can force the air from the lungs of an enemy, inhibiting
spell- casting and breath attacks for a short time.

This racial is only available to users who ALIGN or have an innate
connection to the element of air.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This racial has one very particular use: preventing spec_priest mobs
such as Paehandra from exploding all over your group. For best effect,
align ahead of time, and suffocate her right before she reaches "big
nasty" as that is the point where the mob script will attempt to cast
martyr.

There is one huge caveat here: this racial afflicts the target with a 0
tick affect, which means that it can effectively last a matter of
milliseconds if badly timed, as a tick immediately following your cast
will remove the affect. It will last anywhere from 1-30 seconds
depending on your timing.
