*This is a potential extra attack. As it is automatic and random, you
have no control over either the use of or improvement of it.*

This racial attack will lag its victims when it lands. There is also a
small chance that a tail attack will deliver a KATHUNK, a crippling blow
that reduces the victim's hit points to 1. Both mobs and players with
racial tail have the chance of KATHUNKing each other.
