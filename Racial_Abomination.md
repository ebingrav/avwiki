*The Curse of [Quixoltan](Quixoltan.md "wikilink") causes the corpses of
[Draconians](Draconians.md "wikilink") to decay almost immediately after
they [die](Death.md "wikilink"). The corpses cannot be
[embalmed](Embalm.md "wikilink") or preserved in any way by mortals.*

The corpse rots and the contents spill onto the ground on the next tic.
