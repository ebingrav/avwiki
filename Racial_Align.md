*Races with a strong connection to the elements can attempt to align
themselves to a specific element to gain access to additional abilities.
The available elements are fire, air, water and earth. You may not align
to more than one element at once.*

Syntax: racial align <element>

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a time when used.

The abilities granted by racial-align are a bit different than the
racials of the [hero-level elemental
type](:Category:Imps.md "wikilink"). Align water and align earth are
most often used, though air is uniquely capable of disabling pesky
caster mobs. Racial align will augment the damage type of melee attacks
with the current element, similar to [Racial
Imbue](Racial_Imbue "wikilink").

[burn](Racial_Burn.md "wikilink")
