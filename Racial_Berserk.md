*A [race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") prone to berserking has the
potential to become enraged when hurt, raising [damage
roll](Damage_Roll.md "wikilink") at the expense of [armor
class](Armor_Class.md "wikilink"). Several different levels of rage are
possible, depending on how frequently the
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") is hurt. The
[calm](Calm.md "wikilink") and [awe](Awe.md "wikilink")
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") can slow the effects of
berserk, and the [frenzy](Frenzy.md "wikilink")
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") will exacerbate them.*
