*This is a breath attack that [Dragons](Dragons "wikilink") may use. It
can only be used once before having to rest. Typing 'racial breath' with
no target attacks a [mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") you are already in
combat with.*

*Typing 'racial breath all' will try to attack all enemies in the room
with the breath attack. However, this requires a high level of breath
power.*

Syntax: racial breath <target>

or racial breath

or racial breath all -- *available at hero 750+*

## Comments

This gets more powerful at higher levels, though I'm not sure if it's
slightly more with each level or jumps abruptly at certain stages.
