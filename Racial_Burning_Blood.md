''[Fire Giants](Fire_Giants "wikilink") can invite elemental fire to
course through their very veins. This fills the [Fire
Giant](Fire_Giants.md "wikilink") with great haste, granting them the
ability to perform an extra attack per round. It also surrounds the
[Fire Giant](Fire_Giants.md "wikilink") with a [FIRE
AURA](FIRE_AURA "wikilink") that will lick at any foe that ventures too
close.

These benefits come at a price, though. Any [Fire
Giant](Fire_Giants.md "wikilink") utilizing this technique will suffer
continuous pain as long as their blood continues to burn.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a long time when used.''
