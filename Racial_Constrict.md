''Green Dragons have long, powerful tails that they can use to squeeze
the life out of their enemies. While a Green Dragon is attempting to
constrict, they forgo their normal tail attack. Instead, they attempt to
perform a more powerful constriction attack for the duration of this
affect.

''When this attack is successful, the Green Dragon wraps their tail
around the victim like a snake and squeezes as hard as they can. This
removes a significant portion of the foe's remaining health. A Green
Dragon can only constrict a foe that is physically smaller than him.

''Attempting to perform a constriction attack demands much of the Green
Dragon's focus. As a result, he is less likely to swing his weapon
multiple times in a single combat round while this affect is active.

''This racial is EXHAUSTED for a long time when used.
