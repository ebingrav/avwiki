*Not living, but rather, creatures animated through arcane power,
constructs like [golems](Golems.md "wikilink") and elementals receive
little healing from divine or psionic sources, but receive more than
usual from Arcane casters.*

*Nothing can be done to alter this state of being, short of remorting to
a different race!*

## Comments

Constructs receive -50% heal from divine and psionic sources and +100%
from arcane sources. Healing from arcane sources can be achieved by
having arcane classes (eg, Mages, Wizards, Sorcerers) brandish healing
staves.

Note that the Cleric's [artificer
blessing](Artificer_Blessing.md "wikilink") aura allows for increased
healing to constructs.

This racial also grants immunity from poisons and diseases.
