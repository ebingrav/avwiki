[Gith](Gith "wikilink"). This ability will summon the user's weapon(s)
from across the planes for a short time. It can be resummoned later if
lost or destroyed.

The power of the weapon will grow with the power of the
[Gith](Gith "wikilink").

This racial is [EXHAUSTED](Exhaustion "wikilink") for a short time when
