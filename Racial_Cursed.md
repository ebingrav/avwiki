*The Gods were not pleased, and laid a mighty curse upon those who
failed to earn their favor. Those unlucky few, being naughty in the
sight of the Gods, found themselves unable to recall or seek sanctum!
Further, they were not allowed to petition the Gods for boons of any
kind, no matter how devoutly they worshipped or how much they
sacrificed.*

*Cursed races will find that they are able to recall only from
mudschool, the arena, and safe rooms.*

*The effects of this racial are automatic.*
