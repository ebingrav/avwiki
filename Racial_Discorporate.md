Syntax: racial discorporate

Races with a strong connection to the element of air can assume gaseous
form, effectively putting them out of phase with the material world for
a short time. Users will find themselves temporarily invulnerable to
enemy attacks! While discorporated, users cannot initiate or be drawn
into combat, manipulate objects, or cast spells.

This racial is only available to users who have an innate connection to
the element of air.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a long time when used.
