*A [race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") with earth-embrace has lived
very long and has been blessed by the earth with an uncanny ability to
remember what they have learned, even when facing the harsh reality of
[death](Death.md "wikilink"). While automatic, this earthen [racial
ability](:Category:_Racials.md "wikilink") treats
[death](Death.md "wikilink") as if you had 1/10th the
[TNL](TNL.md "wikilink"), thus reducing the experience penalty when
[dying](Death.md "wikilink").*
