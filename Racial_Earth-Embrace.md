*A [race](:Category:_Races "wikilink") with earth-embrace has lived very
long and has been blessed by the earth with an uncanny ability to
remember what they have learned, even when facing the harsh reality of
[death](Death "wikilink"). While automatic, this earthen [racial
ability](:Category:_Racials "wikilink") treats [death](Death "wikilink")
as if you had 1/10th the [TNL](TNL "wikilink"), thus reducing the
experience penalty when [dying](Death "wikilink").*
