Syntax: racial tremor <target>

A powerful earth tremor can be summoned against any grounded target. The
affected target will lose its footing and may be knocked down.

This racial is only available to users who ALIGN or have an innate
connection to the element of earth.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

This ability is more powerful than a normal bash (it is capable of
bashing Duke Zarradyn and other "too large" mobs), but it is not as
strong as felling weapon.
