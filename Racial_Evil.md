*A [race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") with this curse is innately
evil, and their [alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink") will tend to edge

[races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") to achieve neutrality, and even
good [alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink"), but it's going to take a lot
more fighting evil than it normally would.*
