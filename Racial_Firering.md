Syntax: racial firering

Races possessing the power of elemental fire may summon a ring of flames
surrounding them. Any creature passing through the ring will suffer
damage from the intense heat.

This racial is only available to users who ALIGN or have an innate
connection to the element of fire.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

This is completely useless except at Legend where it is funny.
