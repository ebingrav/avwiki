*This is similar to the [fly](Fly.md "wikilink")
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink"), but it can't be used on
another. The use of [racial skills](:Category:_Racials.md "wikilink")
causes fatigue, and a need for rest. You can shorten the need of rest by
landing earlier.*

Syntax: racial fly.

Racial fly will sometimes help with melee hitting by negating an
opponents dodge. When it works it gives a message like this:

` Swooping sideways you thwart a gathering of the trogs's attempt to dodge your attack!`
