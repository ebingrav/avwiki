''By summoning the power of the Frozen North, a White Dragon can make
their scales as cold as ice. This can chill any assailant who strikes
the White Dragon, causing them to become more susceptible to cold
damage. Further attempts to strike the White Dragon may result in the
assailant's chill becoming more severe.

''Beings who are naturally resistant to cold are less likely to suffer
from this chilling affect.

''This racial is EXHAUSTED for a long time when used.
