''This ability allows you to summon the wintry chill of the Frozen
North. This creates an [aura](aura "wikilink") that provides increased
resistance to fire damage for you and your allies.

The cold makes your flesh more brittle though, causing your party to
become slightly more susceptible to the various forms of physical
damage. Your allies that lack an innate resistance to cold will also
find themselves slightly more susceptible to cold damage while they are
under the affects of this [aura](aura "wikilink").

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a long time when used. ''
