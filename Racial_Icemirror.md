''With this racial ability, you can coat your body with a thin layer of
magically reflective ice. While this mirror remains, any targeted
offensive spell cast upon you will be reflected back onto its caster.

''The reflection process reverses the polarity of the spell. This causes
the effectiveness of the reflected spell to be partially determined by
the innate spellcasting prowess of the mirror's bearer. For example, a
spell reflected off of a mage will be more potent than a spell reflected
off of a warrior.

''This mirror is very fragile. Any direct physical damage will destroy
it.

''This racial is EXHAUSTED for a long time when used.
