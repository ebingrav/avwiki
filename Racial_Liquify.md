Syntax: racial liquify

Races imbued with the elemental power of water may attempt to turn their
bodies into liquid! Users in liquid form will find that their hit points
regenerate at a much higher rate than normal. Due to their alien
physiology, users will also find that healing spells do not work as well
on them. In addition, the form is somewhat fragile, causing users to
take more damage from enemy spells and breath attacks.

This racial is only available to users who ALIGN or have an innate
connection to the element of water.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

This is basically a half-power racial revive, with a couple additional
downsides. Use it early and often.
