Syntax: racial lithify

The power of elemental earth is strong in some races, allowing them to
temporarily turn themselves to stone! While lithified, users will find
that they are ignored by most enemies. This racial is SUSTAINED, and
will break if the user attempts any other action.

This racial is only available to users who ALIGN or have an innate
connection to the element of earth.

This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is basically the same effect as the force field spell, which makes
it a really bad idea to ever use: if you are aligned to earth you are
presumably taking advantage of racial armorstone to tank better, and
using this will make you no longer be the tank.
