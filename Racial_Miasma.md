''Green Dragons have the ability to spew forth a cloud of poisonous gas.
This miasma reduces the accuracy of melee attacks performed by friend &
foe alike for as long as it lingers in the room.

''The poison of the miasma does not remain in the victim's body after it
has been exhaled. Thus once you move out of the room containing the gas
cloud, you are no longer affected by its poison.

''Resistance or susceptibility to poison impacts how much of a penalty
you suffer from the miasma. Those who are immune to poison are
unaffected by the cloud.

''This racial is EXHAUSTED for a long time when used.

Syntax: racial miasma
