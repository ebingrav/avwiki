*This [racial ability](:Category:_Racials.md "wikilink") functions
exactly like the [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") for which it
is named. Like most [racials](:Category:_Racials.md "wikilink"), it
requires rest between uses.*

Syntax: racial movehidden.

## Comments

Gives movehidden for 24 ticks on a 8-10 tick cooldown. Unlike the skill,
racial movehidden can be activated any time, including during combat.
Also the racial versions of [sneak](Racial_Sneak.md "wikilink") and
movehidden are supposedly slightly more effective ("sneakier") than the
corresponding skills.
