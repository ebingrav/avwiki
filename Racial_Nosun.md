*All [races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") have certain attributes,
and a number of the underground [races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink")
are affected by NOSUN, which means they should not be outdoors on a
sunny day without expecting consequences. The sun will not damage the
underground dwellers but will prevent regeneration and will tell you
that you are smoking. You will not be harmed by the sun, in Limbo, on
the Cloud, or if you are [level](Level.md "wikilink") 10 or lower.*
