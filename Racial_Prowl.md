''What better time to stalk your foes than during the dead of night?

''Being on a midnight prowl slightly improves your stealth. You'll have
a better chance to dodge your enemies attacks, and they will find it
more difficult to dodge yours.

''As the name implies, you can only begin a midnight prowl during the
nighttime. This ability does nothing once the sun rises, even though it
may still show up in your affects list.

''This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.
