*This [racial ability](:Category:_Racials "wikilink") functions exactly
like the [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") for which it is named.
Like most [racials](:Category:_Racials "wikilink"), it requires rest
between uses.*

Syntax: racial sneak.

## Comments

Gives sneak for 8 ticks with a 8-10 tick cooldown. Unlike the skill,
racial sneak can be activated any time, including during combat. Also
the racial versions of sneak and
[movehidden](Racial_Movehidden "wikilink") are supposedly slightly more
effective ("sneakier") than the corresponding skills.
