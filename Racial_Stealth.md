*Stealth is two-fold: A stealthy [race](:Category:_Races "wikilink") is
less likely to be attacked by [aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") when a less-stealthy target also
presents itself. A stealthy [race](:Category:_Races "wikilink") will
also succeed more often with [rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink")
[skills](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") such as
[blackjack](Blackjack "wikilink"), [backstab](Backstab "wikilink") and
[sneak attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink"). Some examples of stealthy
[races](:Category:_Races "wikilink") include [Drow](Drow "wikilink"),
[Halfling](Halflings "wikilink") and [Demonseed](Demonseeds "wikilink").
Some examples of non-stealthy [races](:Category:_Races "wikilink")
include [Giant](Giants "wikilink"), [Troglodyte](Troglodytes "wikilink")
and [Troll](Trolls "wikilink").*
