*Stealth is two-fold: A stealthy [race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink")
is less likely to be attacked by
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink")
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") when a less-stealthy target also
presents itself. A stealthy [race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") will
also succeed more often with [rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink")
[skills](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") such as
[blackjack](Blackjack.md "wikilink"), [backstab](Backstab.md "wikilink")
and [sneak attack](Sneak_Attack.md "wikilink"). Some examples of
stealthy [races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") include
[Drow](Drow.md "wikilink"), [Halfling](Halflings.md "wikilink") and
[Demonseed](Demonseeds.md "wikilink"). Some examples of non-stealthy
[races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") include
[Giant](Giants.md "wikilink"), [Troglodyte](Troglodytes.md "wikilink")
and [Troll](Trolls.md "wikilink").*
