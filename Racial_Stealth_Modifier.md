**Every race** has a racial stealth modifier associated with it. From
the in-game help for Racial Stealth:

> *Stealth is two-fold:* *A stealthy race is less likely to be attacked
> by aggressive mobs when a less-stealthy target also presents itself.*
>
> *A stealthy race will also succeed more often with rogue skills such
> as blackjack, backstab and sneak attack.*
>
> *Some examples of stealthy races include Drow, Halfling and
> Demonseed.*
>
> *Some examples of non-stealthy races include Giant, Troglodyte and
> Troll.*

Because we can't be sure exactly what the number is, we have simply
assigned each race a rating of **-3** to **2**, with negative numbers
being a penalty, **0** meaning "no modifier", and **2** being the best
modifier possible. -3 is a failure rate of approximately 50%, -2 is 20%,
and -1 is 5%. Note that size and groupsize both affect the success rate
of disengage and slip, and are separate from the inherent stealth
modifier.

There is also a separate [archery damage
modifier](Racial_Archery_Modifier.md "wikilink") and [melee damage
modifier](Racial_Damage_Modifier.md "wikilink") for each race.

Please note that all of this information has been gleaned from
[race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") pages here as well as discussion
in-game, and is subject to change at any time. Also, entries for
evolution races should reflect their maximum (highest evolve).

## Stealth Modifiers, Rogue Skills, And You

Performance as a rogue is not exclusively or even primarily determined
by the stealth modifier. Dexterity, [ racial damage
modifier](Racial_Damage_Modifier "wikilink") and [
size](Racial_Size.md "wikilink") also affect [ rogue
skills](:Category:Rogue_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") to varying
degrees but these are separate from the hidden natural stealth modifier
as described above. Many players strongly prefer sturdy races with high
damage output to small agile races when they create a rogue, as rogues
have difficulty avoiding taking damage in the course of their duties.

Most races do not have a stealth modifier. The stealth modifier is most
plainly obvious when using backstab, as when it is rolled you get the
message "it sees you coming from a mile away" and your backstab fails
completely. From this you can clearly see some things - trolls have a
-5% modifier, dragons are -20%. However, it doesn't measure positive
stealth modifier in any way, and these positive stealth modifiers are
extremely rare... most races which are considered "stealthy" are just
neutral with above average intelligence/dex, which is sufficient to
succeed on backstab all the time.

Other skills fail for other reasons - most importantly, slip and
disengage are strongly affected by size and groupsize, as your ability
to disappear in a crowd is considered extremely important there. "Nils"
on assassinate and backstab occur at a flat rate regardless of race or
class. From this we can see differences in orc and troll stealth
performance, despite them having the same negative modifier - orcs have
more dex, and also are medium instead of large, so they stab slightly
better and slip significantly better.

Fumbles from [Murder](Murder "wikilink"), which also result in Nil
damage (i.e, "You fumble! You fierily hit troll skirmisher with nil
intensity."), seem to occur roughly equivalent to the racial stealth
modifier percentages given above (i.e, 5/20/50% for modifiers -1/2/3
respectively).

Some might say a rough indicator of a race's "innate stealthiness" can
be gotten by looking at how many of the sneaky racials that race has.
These would be racial [sneak](Racial_Sneak.md "wikilink"),
[hide](Racial_Hide.md "wikilink"), and
[movehidden](Racial_Movehidden.md "wikilink").
