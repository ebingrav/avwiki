*This [racial ability](:Category:_Racials.md "wikilink") grants virtual
immunity to most forms of mental manipulation. Although still prone to
psionic damage, the user will be mostly unaffected by
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") such as
[overconfidence](Overconfidence.md "wikilink"),
[fervor](Fervor.md "wikilink"), and [frenzy](Frenzy.md "wikilink").*

This is an amazing racial. Among others, it prevents
[fervor](fervor "wikilink"), [frenzy](frenzy "wikilink"),
[overconfidence](overconfidence "wikilink") and
[scramble](scramble "wikilink").  
And, because it prevents frenzy, when spelling yourself you can just use
full [awen](awen "wikilink"), saving yourself a lot of spell lag.
