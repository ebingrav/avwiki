''This ability allows you to summon a wave of Elemental Water to come
crashing down on one of your foes. This causes moderate damage.

''The wave is likely to drag the enemy into an adjacent room of your
choosing. When this happens, the victim may also be stunned by the force
of the crashing wave.

''Unlike some other racial abilities, you can waterblast a foe that you
are not directly engaged in combat with.

''This racial is EXHAUSTED for a short time when used.

Syntax: racial waterblast <target> <direction>

(sentinel)](Sentinel_Mobs.md "wikilink") flag and it will not move mobs
