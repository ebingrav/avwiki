*This troll's post overlooks the Mountain Trail stretching to Wildwood,
but considering his army recently laid waste to that part of the
countryside, there's very little in the way of organized threats he
needs to watch for. The sentry spends most of his time looking back down
into the city, where his fellow soldiers drill on a shining mica plain.*

or  
*Growling in concentration, the troll points his crossbow toward the
farmland to the south and takes careful aim. It's not like the city is
at a call to arms; might as well help fill the garrison's larder while
nobody else is stopping him.*
