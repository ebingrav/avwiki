*This mans face is distorted into a mask of pain. It seems unbelievable
that something as simple as [the piece of wood](Broken_Wand "wikilink")
he holds should be able to cause it. He rips his eyes of it and answers
the question he sees in yours. 'Hah, no. Once [this
wand](Fused_Wand "wikilink") was a powerful thing, but now it is just [a
piece of broken wood](Broken_Wand "wikilink"). But to find it in the
wrecked part of this old forest to the north, where shadows and creeping
moss destroy the beauty, that is ... bad. It belonged to [an old friend
of mine](Moss_Shrouded_Man "wikilink"), a
[mage](:Category:_Mages "wikilink"), not the worst, not the best. But he
must either have perished there, or he is the cause of it all. A long
time before I lost contact to him he began to take up the study of the
darker forces of nature, its twisted ways. He always believed he could
control them, the same vain hope shared by so many others he read
about - I just hope he does not control this disaster...*'
