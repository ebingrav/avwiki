*This mans face is distorted into a mask of pain. It seems unbelievable
that something as simple as [the piece of
wood](Broken_Wand.md "wikilink") he holds should be able to cause it. He
rips his eyes of it and answers the question he sees in yours. 'Hah, no.
Once [this wand](Fused_Wand.md "wikilink") was a powerful thing, but now
it is just [a piece of broken wood](Broken_Wand.md "wikilink"). But to
find it in the wrecked part of this old forest to the north, where
shadows and creeping moss destroy the beauty, that is ... bad. It
belonged to [an old friend of mine](Moss_Shrouded_Man.md "wikilink"), a
[mage](:Category:_Mages.md "wikilink"), not the worst, not the best. But
he must either have perished there, or he is the cause of it all. A long
time before I lost contact to him he began to take up the study of the
darker forces of nature, its twisted ways. He always believed he could
control them, the same vain hope shared by so many others he read
about - I just hope he does not control this disaster...*'
