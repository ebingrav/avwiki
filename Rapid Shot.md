**Prerequisites: scattershot, held shot**  
**Syntax: rapid**

*A rapid shot is an attempt to fire twice at the same target in quick
succession. You must already be in combat to use rapid shot. Each shot
will deal full damage and inflict the usual secondary effects, but the
chance to fumble is increased.*

*Only shortbows and longbows are capable of firing rapid shot.*

*Rapid shot can be used three times before become exhausted.*
