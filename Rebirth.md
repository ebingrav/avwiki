Syntax: tell [Weaver](Weaver "wikilink") rebirth <choice>

`       confirm rebirth `<your password>

Over the years, the players of AVATAR have learned how to be reborn. A
player who is eligible to be reborn can choose from a variety of classes
and/or races. The details are contained in the following helpfiles:

`  - REBIRTH RACE`  
`  - REBIRTH CLASS`  
`  - REBIRTH EXCEPTIONS`  
`  - REBIRTH GAME CHANGES`  
`  - REBIRTH QUESTS`

Being reborn requires one to change rapidly, and as such, it will never
be an option for an evolutionary race or an ent.

**Rebirth Race**

Players can be reborn as a new race. To be eligible, you must have been
re-incarnated at least once. Race options for rebirth become available
as you complete the rebirth quests from the ambassadors.

NOTE: REBIRTH will clear all your DC insignias and return you to level
2.

You can never be reborn as an ent, or an evolutionary race.

The current rebirth race options and requirements are as follows:


    From                    To                       Level Required
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Remort Race         Creatable Race               Anytime
    Remort Race         Remort Race                  Hero 501 (*)

-   Must be a valid option for that race (e.g., tuataur to dragon)

EXCEPTIONS: You can not rebirth to ENT, FDK, GOL, HIE, HOB, HUM, LSI or
MIR. Only TUA can rebirth to DRG.

**Rebirth Class**

Players can be reborn as a new class. To be eligible, you must have been
re-incarnated at least once. Class options for rebirth become available
as you complete the rebirth quests from the trainers.

NOTE: REBIRTH will clear all your insignias and return you to level 2.

The current rebirth class options and requirements are as follows:


    From                    To                       Level Required
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Remort Class         Creatable Class             Anytime
    Remort Class         Remort Class                Hero 501
    Prestige Class       Base Class                  Anytime

Prestige classes can only revert to the base class required to prestige.
So a Wizard can revert to a Mage, but not a Warrior.
