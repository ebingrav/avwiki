*CLASS REBUILD: With this [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"),
certain [classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") can change their
[class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") to another. They are effectively
rebuilt from the ground up and will have to re-[train](Train "wikilink")
and re-[practice](Practice "wikilink")
[skills](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells "wikilink") as a "new"
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink"). Those
[classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") which qualify due to being
[grandfathered](:Category:_Grandfathered_Classes "wikilink") can rebuild
into an equivalent [level](Level "wikilink").*

*RACE EVOLUTION: With this [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"),
certain [races](:Category:_Races "wikilink") can evolve from one
[race](:Category:_Races "wikilink") into another. They maintain their
[level](Level "wikilink") and are remade into their new image. Like
[classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink"), this will require
[retraining](Train "wikilink") and [repracticing](Practice "wikilink").
This is a serious decision and those who use the rebuild
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") cannot go back to their old
[class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink"). Rebuilds are final.*

Syntax: rebuild <password>
