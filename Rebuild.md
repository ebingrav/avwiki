*CLASS REBUILD: With this [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"),
certain [classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") can change their
[class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") to another. They are
effectively rebuilt from the ground up and will have to
re-[train](Train.md "wikilink") and
re-[practice](Practice.md "wikilink")
[skills](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells.md "wikilink") as a "new"
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"). Those
[classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") which qualify due to being
[grandfathered](:Category:_Grandfathered_Classes.md "wikilink") can
rebuild into an equivalent [level](Level.md "wikilink").*

*RACE EVOLUTION: With this [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"),
certain [races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") can evolve from one
[race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") into another. They maintain their
[level](Level.md "wikilink") and are remade into their new image. Like
[classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink"), this will require
[retraining](Train.md "wikilink") and
[repracticing](Practice.md "wikilink"). This is a serious decision and
those who use the rebuild [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink")
cannot go back to their old [class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink").
Rebuilds are final.*

Syntax: rebuild <password>
