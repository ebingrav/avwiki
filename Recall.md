Syntax: RECALL ( or '/' which is the quick-key)

`       RECALL SET`  
`       RECALL RESET`  
`       RECALL LOCATION or RECALL SHOW`

RECALL is a command that will transport you to a preset destination.
There is a downside, however. Recalling costs some of your movement
points. If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than
for fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than
for fleeing). A player can not recall while cursed.

RECALL SET "sets" your recall to the room you are currently in. This
essentially changes your recall point to this new location. Although not
every room will not allow you to set your recall to it.

RECALL RESET resets your recall as follows: Levels 1-4 resets to
[Nom](Nom "wikilink") in the center of the Meadow. Levels 5-14 reset to
[Sol](Sol "wikilink") in Stonehall. Levels 15+ reset to
[Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink") in Midgaard.

RECALL LOCATION or RECALL SHOW tells you where your recall is set.
