*The unusual color of this orc's skin closely resembles the reddish
brown earth of the surrounding terrain.*

<wielded>`           a red dusted hand axe`

**Keywords:** red, orc, ???.  
**[Level](Level.md "wikilink"):** 55.  
**[Alignment](Alignment.md "wikilink"):** ???.  
**[Flags](:Category:_Mob_Types.md "wikilink"):**
[aggressive](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink").  
**Affects:** ???.  

## Gear

The axe disappears on death and so cannot be looted.

Various different versions of this orc exist; at least one carries [Red
Glowing Dust](Red_Glowing_Dust "wikilink").

## Comments

Several of these mobs spawn in the first few rooms of Forge. If all of
them are killed, [A Landslide of Red
Stone](A_landslide_of_red_stone.md "wikilink") is spawned in the room
with the [Mountain Giant](Mountain_Giant "wikilink") and hunts down and
attacks the player.

Tried skinning one and it did not skin to anything useful.

## Directions

pp white raven, east and there are some around.
