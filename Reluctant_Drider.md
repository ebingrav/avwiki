*Ignoring the cold that nips at the legs of her body, this drider
marches along with dogged purpose towards her destination. She isn't
exactly sure what she is looking for, as Lloth did not give her many

female must place her trust in the goddess, she was told, or the entire
race might fall into chaos and be destroyed by a whim of Veyah
L'Aturii.*
