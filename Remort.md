*The remort process is how some of AVATAR's experimental or powerful
[races](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink") and
[classes](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink") are accessed. The user will
be reset to a [level](Level.md "wikilink") 2
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") of the new
[race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink"), and their current
[class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink"), or a
[level](Level.md "wikilink") 2
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") of the new
[class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink"), and either
[human](Humans.md "wikilink") or their old
[race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink"), depending on how high
[level](Level.md "wikilink") they were when they remorted. The purpose
of this is to give people a chance to try something different. After you
remort to another [class](:Category:_Classes.md "wikilink"), the remort
[level](Level.md "wikilink") requirement goes up by 100
[Lord](:Category:_Lord.md "wikilink") [levels](Sublevel.md "wikilink").
Be sure to read the appropriate helps and make absolutely certain you
want to remort before using the
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"). It is irreversible.*
