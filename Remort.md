*The remort process is how some of AVATAR's experimental or powerful
[races](:Category:_Races "wikilink") and
[classes](:Category:_Classes "wikilink") are accessed. The user will be
reset to a [level](Level "wikilink") 2
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") of the new
[race](:Category:_Races "wikilink"), and their current
[class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink"), or a [level](Level "wikilink") 2
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") of the new
[class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink"), and either
[human](Humans "wikilink") or their old
[race](:Category:_Races "wikilink"), depending on how high
[level](Level "wikilink") they were when they remorted. The purpose of
this is to give people a chance to try something different. After you
remort to another [class](:Category:_Classes "wikilink"), the remort
[level](Level "wikilink") requirement goes up by 100
[Lord](:Category:_Lord "wikilink") [levels](Sublevel "wikilink"). Be
sure to read the appropriate helps and make absolutely certain you want
to remort before using the [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"). It
is irreversible.*

Syntax: remort <password> \<[race-abbr](:Category:_Races "wikilink")\>.
