Syntax: repair <object name>  
Prerequisites: [Weapon
Lore](http://avatar.melanarchy.info/index.php?title=Weapon_Lore), [Armor
Lore](http://avatar.melanarchy.info/index.php?title=Armor_Lore)

Repairing an object damaged in battle yourself is a convenient way to
save the cost of paying a smith. There is a drawback to repairing
something yourself, rather than having an expert do it, however. Being
an amateur, every time you repair something, you create small flaws that
weaken the overall strength of that object.

Certain races who have a natural affinity for or with metals and other
materials are able to repair an object without the risk of damaging it.

NOTE: There are shops that will do the same thing, but for a price.

This skill is in-class for Lord Warriors, Paladins and Bodyguards.
