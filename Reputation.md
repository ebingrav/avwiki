*Not really a skill, per se, an Assassin's deadly reputation can
sometimes make attackers rethink their choice of target. Reputation
cannot be practiced. It must be earned...*

Assassins earn 1% through a successful [Insightful
Strike](Insightful_Strike "wikilink").  
You will know you were successful because you will receive a message
that says in cyan: Your Reputation Grows...  
There is also a quest in Midgaard that involves completing [Assassin
Contracts](Assassin_Contracts "wikilink"), and rewards with 1 reputation
point.

Assassins lose 1% when they flee, even when caused by a spell
([Dread](Dread "wikilink")).  
Max that can be earned at Hero for Assassins is at least 80%.
**Updated:** Max reputation for Lord Assassins is also 80%.  
You can check your reputation by typing 'slearn reputation'.

When you achieve 1% reputation, slearn will display that "you have been
blocked from learning reputation". Don't freak out! This is normal. You
won't see a percentage until you reach 2%.  
[Black Circle
Initiates](:Category:_Black_Circle_Initiates.md "wikilink") also get a
certain reputation (20%) due to the nature of the Circle but this is not
earned and can not be lost.  
**What the skill does:** Your reputation percentage represents the
chance that an aggressive mob will attack (aggie) a groupie instead of
you; if you have 100% reputation, in theory, you will never get aggied
in a room with living groupies.
