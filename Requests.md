    -   I could be wrong, but I think Shalineth is requesting something
        like [List Of Gear Runs](List_Of_Gear_Runs "wikilink"), but [for
        exp](List_Of_Exp_Runs.md "wikilink").

a tintin++ script to make stabbing at lord easier

a tintin++ script to add and remove named weapons from retrieval and
return list, for psi weapons. ideally would be able to add two item
names and player associated with them, so that if picked up off ground
or looted from corpse the weapons would be automatically returned to
their owner. maybe by typing something like "psiadd
Tomy,psiwield,psiheld". i tried making a simple one based on AutoRescue
but no luck.--[3nki](User:3nki.md "wikilink") 13:30, 16 November 2011

**Request:** Zmud sharpen triggers. I'm listing the outputs myself. For
that, I need the message you get from a dull, a shatter, a brill
sharpen, a good presence and a bad presence. The others I have. Please
lemme know if you have these logged somewhere.

-   Regular sharpen:
    -   You smile as you feel the increased sharpness of <object>!
-   Brill:
    -   Your hands tingle as a brilliant green light bursts from
        <object>!
-   Dull:
    -   You sigh as you realize you have slipped and dulled <object>!

-   Dull prevented by Durr:
    -   You almost dull the <object>, but Durr steadies your hand!

[Morague](User:Morague.md "wikilink") 04:45, 9 December 2007 (HST)

-   Nothing happens
    -   Despite your efforts, nothing happens to <object>!
-   Fully sharp
    -   The weapon is now as sharp as it is going to get!
-   Whetstone used up
    -   The whetstone crumbles out of your hand.
