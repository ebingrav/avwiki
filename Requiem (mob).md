*This man looks young, but his eyes say otherwise. They speak volumes
about what he's seen over the ages he's lived. He smiles at you and
speaks in a quiet, harmonious voice, "Good day to you! Allow me to
introduce myself... ah, hmm, that could be bit of a problem. I go by
many names. You may call me Requiem. I am pleased to see you've made it
this far in your travels. I apologize for the route I forced you to take
to get here, I can understand it can be very trying. As a reward for
your dignity and your visit I will allow you to use a special exit I
made, south, that leads to the [healer](:Category:_Healers "wikilink")
you know as [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink")." He pauses, then continues with
a grin, "Also, I have in my possession [a
sword](Orchid-Hilted_Sword "wikilink") that will steel yourself should
you walk your own downward spiral in the future. All I ask for it is
[the small mirror](Hand-Held_Mirror "wikilink") that [your
mirror-self](Mimic "wikilink") had."*
