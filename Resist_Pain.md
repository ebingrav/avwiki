*[Berserkers](:Category:_Berserkers.md "wikilink") have been rumored to
go so deep into their rages that they don't even notice injuries. This
Rite will reduce damage taken during regular melee
[rounds](Rounds.md "wikilink"). The first round, the reduction is about
equal to [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink"), but it decreases quickly
as the battle draws on. The counter that tracks this
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") ONLY refreshes when the user
gains non-zero [exp](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") AND there is no
other fighting in the [room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink"). If the
user [flees](Flee.md "wikilink") or the fight ends some other way, he
must gain [exp](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") or wait 24 ticks before
the [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") will function properly
again. Resist Pain will not function if the
[Berserker](:Category:_Berserkers.md "wikilink") has better than -750
[AC](Armor_Class.md "wikilink") at
[hero](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink"), or -1250
[AC](Armor_Class.md "wikilink") at
[Lord](:Category:Lord.md "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: none (automatic).
