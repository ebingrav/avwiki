*[Berserkers](:Category:_Berserkers "wikilink") have been rumored to go
so deep into their rages that they don't even notice injuries. This Rite
will reduce damage taken during regular melee
[rounds](Rounds "wikilink"). The first round, the reduction is about
equal to [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"), but it decreases quickly as
the battle draws on. The counter that tracks this
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") ONLY refreshes when the user gains
non-zero [exp](Experience_Points "wikilink") AND there is no other
fighting in the [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"). If the user
[flees](Flee "wikilink") or the fight ends some other way, he must gain
[exp](Experience_Points "wikilink") or wait 24 ticks before the
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") will function properly again.
Resist Pain will not function if the
[Berserker](:Category:_Berserkers "wikilink") has better than -750
[AC](Armor_Class "wikilink") at [hero](:Category:_Hero "wikilink"), or
-1250 [AC](Armor_Class "wikilink") at
[Lord](:Category:Lord "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: none (automatic).
