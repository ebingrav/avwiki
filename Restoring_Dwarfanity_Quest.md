This is a quest that starts in [Sun God
Altar](:Category:Sun_God_Altar "wikilink") but involves other Eragoran
areas. Speak to [Grogbert
Thunderbeard](Grogbert_Thunderbeard "wikilink") and see if he has
anything for you to do.

One thing he wants is the luminscent stalk, skinned from a mammoth iwei.

Once completed it awards the [Restoring Dwarfanity
Insignia](Restoring_Dwarfanity_Insignia "wikilink"), as well as one or
two items of use, depending on certain factors.

Since these item(s) are bound, they must be important, right? It would
be a shame to lose these once-per-incarnation opportunities.
