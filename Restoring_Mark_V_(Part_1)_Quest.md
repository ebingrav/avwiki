The quest involves locating an anchor and a crystal shaft that
[Angharad, The Hediad](Angharad,_The_Hediad "wikilink") offhandedly
claims are missing and stolen years ago. She never actually hires you to
find these, but then again, this isn't a regular quest where you can
easily influence the spawning of tickets.

-   Where are these items? Apparently they were highly prized and stolen
    by the powerful barbarians, the Mawrs, that reside high in the
    mountains and are not really accessible.
-   To get them to descend, you do not have to do anything at all. They
    decide to come down and swarm the Pass every once in a while. When
    this happens a lot of horns blow and it's rather hard to miss. Just
    mind your own business and hopefully it will happen.
-   A gazillion of ultra-rabid gnome berserkers led by the two powerful
    Mawrs will swarm entire area. The fact they are gnomes is heavily
    outweighed by the fact they are lvl 85+ with bosses in the 100+
    range, capable of toss-bashing you for the entire duration of your
    (very short) combat, before shooting you with guns through full ac,
    spells and racial armor-ancient for \*\*DISMEM every single round.
-   As it happens, you can probably try (and die) outmaneuvering them,
    and if by some blind luck you manage to kill the mawrs, return the
    missing items to the Hediad.
-   You will receive a choice - chained or double weapon?

Chained weapon is [Serpent's Tongue](Serpent's_Tongue "wikilink") and
double is the [Lightning Strike](Lightning_Strike "wikilink"). If you
are taking this on a warrior or a bodyguard, remember that the skill
[Double Parry](Double_Parry "wikilink") requires a double weapon, but
the chain grants [Disarm](Disarm "wikilink") bonuses, while both benefit
from [Double Hit](Double_Hit "wikilink"). Choice should reflect your
play-style. For non-warlike classes any of these will do.

You can now continue with the optional [Restoring Mark V (Part 2)
Quest](Restoring_Mark_V_(Part_2)_Quest "wikilink").

**Note**: As all quests that involve a lot of combat, this one is
significantly easier to do with a really large group. Once the gnomes
descend you're really looking at about 80+ level 85-90 mobs that seep
towards the main pass (they cannot enter the hidden passageways back to
the area *proper*) and will eventually fill out the pass with 3-4 mobs
per room. Among them are the two sanced bosses at level 100, which when
killed spawn the megaboss at lvl 110 or so. Killing the megaboss does
not give any special reward. Solo combat against them all is difficult
since they succeed bash/toss very frequently and can easily wipe smaller
groups. Since the area is no-teleport-out zone and also
no-angel-allowed, dying deeper in the pass may mean speedwalking will be
next to impossible and you'll be left to morgue it out. There is also a
corpse eating wolverine in the area which does not make things any
easier. Moral of the story - get a quest-sized group and do it properly
as the experience gains are very high and worth it.
