*In the process of restringing a [bow](:Category:_Bows "wikilink"), an
[archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") tweaks it to suit his personal
shooting style. As [bow](:Category:_Bows "wikilink") tightness
increases, the minimum damage of the bow will go up, as will the
[strength](Strength "wikilink") required to use the bow, or DRAW
STRENGTH. Crossbows can be restrung, but the results are generally not
as dramatic as a restringing a bow. There is a chance of permanently
ruining a [bow item](:Category:_Bows "wikilink") with this
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Archery Lore](Archery_Lore "wikilink").

Syntax: restring \<[bow/crossbow](:Category:_Bows "wikilink")\>
<tighter/looser>.

## Comments

Like fletching and sharpening, worshipping Durr helps when restringing
(by reducing the chance of ruining your bow).

Example messages:

You begin to tighten <item name>  
... but it snaps under the pressure!  
... but something goes wrong!  
... but nothing comes of it.  
... and you're successful!  
... and the string hums in perfect resonance! ...You almost ruin the
long bow, "Deep Shadow", but Durr steadies your hand!
