Syntax: cast 'restructure' <perfect gem target> <gem type>
Prerequisites: reforge and transmute

Powerful psions have mastered the ability to restructure the crystal
power matrices of perfect gems to transform them into different types of
perfect gems. The process isn't perfect and three gems of one type are
required to create one of a different type. Certain types of gems may be
more difficult to create than others especially perfect diamonds whose
hardness prevents them being created at all by this spell.
