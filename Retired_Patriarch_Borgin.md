## Comments

Borgin is one of the higher-level [mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink")
in [Mt. Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr.md "wikilink") and wears no equipment.
As such, the only real value in fighting him is for the
[XP](Experience_Points.md "wikilink"), which is pretty good. He does
[cast](Cast.md "wikilink") [spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink")
from time to time, so you can sometimes get a surprise out of him or he
can hit a group member at the back.

His main value comes from his position as a handy
[portal](Portal.md "wikilink") point for those seeking access to the
[Duergar Stronghold](:Category:_Duergar_Stronghold.md "wikilink") or any
of the [areas](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink") that lie beyond it.
