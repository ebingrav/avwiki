## Comments

Borgin is one of the higher-level [mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") in
[Mt. Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink") and wears no equipment. As
such, the only real value in fighting him is for the
[XP](Experience_Points "wikilink"), which is pretty good. He does
[cast](Cast "wikilink") [spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") from time
to time, so you can sometimes get a surprise out of him or he can hit a
group member at the back.

His main value comes from his position as a handy
[portal](Portal "wikilink") point for those seeking access to the
[Duergar Stronghold](:Category:_Duergar_Stronghold "wikilink") or any of
the [areas](:Category:_Areas "wikilink") that lie beyond it.
