*Syntax: rite (gives information)  
* *rite <name of rite> (learns specified rite)  
* *rite remove <name of rite> (removes rite (legend only))*

*At Hero and above, Berserker class skills work differently than those
of other classes. Called Rites, these skills cannot be practiced, but
instead are selected with the Rite command at the following sublevels:*

*1, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 999*

*Lord Berserkers may select either Hero or Lord level Rites. Heroes who
morph early do not gain Rites for hero levels they skipped. All Lord
level Rites have a Hero level prerequisite. All Rites are automatic when
mastered. Learning one does not require a trainer of any kind.*
