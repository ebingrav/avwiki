*As you look at this [elf](Elves.md "wikilink"), he smiles and
introduces himself warmly as Roccondil, exile from the [Kingdom of the
Willows](:Category:_Kingdom_Of_The_Willows.md "wikilink"), well
northeastward from here. He speaks with enthusiasm regarding
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s
[centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink"), [this beautiful hollow of
theirs](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow.md "wikilink"), and his recent
adventure helping them to escort several of
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink")'s unicorns from this very
grotto to other places of safety. He inquires, "Have you seen my mother,
[Kemenserme](Kemenserme.md "wikilink"), anywhere? She's been so deeply
worried since my father, Kemenvarno, vanished. And poor
[Konk](Konk.md "wikilink") refuses to do anything but stand outside in
that thicket until father returns, even though there's no evidence that
he left this hollow again after he had returned from his scouting
mission. Such a baffling mystery! And we're all feeling a bit edgy now
that yet another one of us has vanished. If you find any evidence of
what became of our two missing soldiers, please be sure to bring it to
[ranger Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink") immediately. I'm sure
that he will reward you handsomely on behalf of all of us."*
