*As you look at this [elf](Elves "wikilink"), he smiles and introduces
himself warmly as Roccondil, exile from the [Kingdom of the
Willows](:Category:_Kingdom_Of_The_Willows "wikilink"), well
northeastward from here. He speaks with enthusiasm regarding
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s
[centaurs](Centaurs "wikilink"), [this beautiful hollow of
theirs](:Category:_Centaur_Hollow "wikilink"), and his recent adventure
helping them to escort several of
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s unicorns from this very
grotto to other places of safety. He inquires, "Have you seen my mother,
[Kemenserme](Kemenserme "wikilink"), anywhere? She's been so deeply
worried since my father, Kemenvarno, vanished. And poor
[Konk](Konk "wikilink") refuses to do anything but stand outside in that
thicket until father returns, even though there's no evidence that he
left this hollow again after he had returned from his scouting mission.
Such a baffling mystery! And we're all feeling a bit edgy now that yet
another one of us has vanished. If you find any evidence of what became
of our two missing soldiers, please be sure to bring it to [ranger
Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink") immediately. I'm sure that he will
reward you handsomely on behalf of all of us."*
