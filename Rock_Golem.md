*Created out of ancient rock, this creature is more like a huge
collection of stones and rocks than a living being. Yet it \*is\* alive.
Slowly stretching to his full height, it towers out over you. While
small beady eyes start to focus, its huge arms, equipped with enormous
hands reach out for you. The golem is one of the tools that Tannah
Machadae uses to install fear in, or to get rid off those who oppose
her.*
