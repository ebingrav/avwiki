*Rogue Lore represents a basic working knowledge of larceny, thievery
and the underworld. Someone versed in this will possess the
street-smarts necessary to mingle with the less-than-lawful without
receiving a stiletto between the shoulder blades. It is probably best to
learn Rogue Lore before ever visiting a [rogue
guild](Rogue_Guild_Terrain "wikilink") to avoid being mistaken for an
outsider. Conversely this [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") will
help a [Rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") recognize law-abiding
[citizens](Citizen_Mobs "wikilink"). This
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") also means a
[Rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") knows how to find and recognize
thief [marks](Markings "wikilink"). These [marks](Markings "wikilink")
are generally subtle carvings hidden around major cities by experienced
pilferers. They are often used to help newer
[Rogues](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") find the local guild, or
identifying good places to rob, or to avoid.
[Rogues](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") can leave messages for each other
with the [mark](Mark "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"). Rogue Lore is necessary to
use [Rogue Tools](:Category:_Rogue_Tools "wikilink") and poisoned
[weapons](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink").
[Examining](Examine "wikilink") a
[tool](:Category:_Rogue_Tools "wikilink") or [poison
item](:Category:_Poisons "wikilink") will also reveal the
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")'s stats to one who knows Rogue
Lore. Also, this [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") teaches a basic
knowledge of the [Thief Cant](Thief_Cant "wikilink"), the lingo of the
underworld. This dialect is perfect for exchanging thiefly secrets
without tipping off any guards who might be listening. In order to be
able to understand the [Cant](Thief_Cant "wikilink"), after
[practicing](Practice "wikilink") Rogue Lore you must type
[SPEAK](Speak "wikilink") [THIEF CANT](Thief_Cant "wikilink") once.*

Prerequisite(s): [Lore](Lore "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
