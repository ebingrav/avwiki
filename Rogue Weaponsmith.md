*The rogue vendor almost blends in to the wall behind him, his body more
resembling the rapier in his hands than his fellow townsfolk. He keeps a
beady eye on you while he adjusts his coat---no doubt concealing all
sorts of illicit wares.*

## Comments

His dagger cannot be looted (disappears when he dies). However it
appears he sells the same one.

You need to be speaking Thief Cant to interact with him. If you buy
something from him he will offer to sell you additional items, of quite
good quality, depending on your class. Often these items will have your
name in them somehow when he sells them to you. Items include: weapon
poisoning kit and a [set of lockpicks](Tools_Of_The_Trade "wikilink").
He charges a gemstone for each item, the exact type of which may vary.
In one instance for me as a bld this was the interaction:

> The rogue weaponsmith tells you 'Hey, that stuff is okay, but only the
> average sucker goes for any of it.'
>
> The rogue weaponsmith tells you 'If you want something a little more
> exclusive... no reason to be too obvious about it. Just give me a
> nod.'
>
> <i>You nod in agreement to him.</i>
>
> The rogue weaponsmith tells you 'How about a nice **set of
> lockpicks**? My clientele demands only be best, so **1 catseye gem**
> would be a bargain for unfettered access through any mortal lock.'
>
> The rogue weaponsmith tells you 'Or how about some **poisoning
> tools**? These are the hallmark of a true professional, and they'll
> only set you back **1 emerald**.'

A lord-level bladedancer was charged 1 fizora for "a set of lockpicks"
(a less exotically named version of [Tools Of The
Trade](Tools_Of_The_Trade "wikilink"))).

A hero-level rogue was charged 1 aquamarine for [Tools Of The
Trade](Tools_Of_The_Trade "wikilink"). The rogue version of this item,
named after the purchaser, is also bound to/owned by the purchaser.

A hero bci was charged 1 emerald for 'a set of lockpicks' and 1
aquamarine gem for 'a collection of poisoning tools' (no special names
for bci it seems).
