*Lizard hunting can be a profitable source of income, but not one
without danger. Apart from the difficulty in hunting down the lizards
and obtaining their pelts, there is also the danger of falling victim to
one of the many less friendly denizens of the deepways. Rojer is an
expert hunter who regularly brings in large hauls and even uses some of
them to craft high quality goods for later sale.*
