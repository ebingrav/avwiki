*"One week. One simple week without people trying to loot the graves in
broad daylight is all I ask. Do I ask for much? No, all I want is some
decency! There are so many OTHER graveyards the necromancers can plunder
but nooo, they always come here, and cause me trouble... Maybe it's
personal? Maybe I am an unlikable sort?"*

*The old tuataur rambles on as he manically shuffles through a large
stack of papers, searching for something, without even noticing you
approach.*

## Comments

Romostaros is 'A busy undertaker is nervously shuffling through
parchments.'

If you look board ('A heavy stone board rests near the entrance, listing
prices and services.') it shows:

    .
    .    Burial in anonymous common grave:     one citrine gemstone
    .    Burial within Liquid Breath:          one sapphire gemstone
    .    Cremation inside the Cineary Vault:   one ruby gemstone
    .    Hanging a skull on the Horn Wall:     one diamond gemstone
    .    Grave outside the Dracoleum:          one fizora gemstone
    .    Crypt outside the Dracoleum:          one fireheart gemstone
    .    Sarchophagus within Halls of Wealth:  one widow tear gemstone
    .    Goldification on the Wall of Hearts:  one bahamut's bloodlet gemstone
    .    Dedicated Throneroom:                 one perfect gemstone
    .

If you give him a [bloodlet stone](bloodlet_stone "wikilink") he says:

*Romostaros the Sane intently peers at the stone with his three eyes for
a long moment.*

*Romostaros the Sane says 'A bloodlet, indeed, but not Bahamut's. There
is no power radiating from it.*'

*Romostaros the Sane gives you bloodlet stone.*

*Romostaros the Sane says 'There are precious few uses for those stones
nowadays. In the past they were used as tokens for some of the machinery
around here, but that was before my time.*'

*Romostaros the Sane says 'Goldification cannot be done without a
Bahamut's bloodlet gemstone, I am sorry.*'

*Romostaros the Sane returns to shuffling through papers, anxiously
searching through records.*
