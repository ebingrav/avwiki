## Comments

Some or all carry an amethyst in their inventory, though not the same
quality of gem that can be deposited at a bank. The amethyst is a level
34 item with a value 540, a weight of 1, and a type of treasure

Zombie bite may cause plague.

The zombies that spawn in the crypts appear to be as described. Once in
a while a zombie spawns on the gravel path. This Rotting Zombie is lower
in level than described and does not carry the amethyst.
