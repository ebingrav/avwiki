*This guard wears heavy chainmail that limits mobility but offers superb
protection in close quarters. An insignia on his cloak looks like a
royal crest. You wonder whether patrolling an obscure abandoned hallway
is an honor or a punishment.*

## Gear

A royal half-orc guard is using:

<worn on body>`      `[`heavy`` ``chainmail`](Heavy_Chainmail.md "wikilink")  
<worn on head>`      `[`horned`` ``helm`](Horned_Helm_(Healing_Springs)‎.md "wikilink")  
<wielded>`           `[`Obsidian-Tipped`` ``Spear`](Obsidian-Tipped_Spear "wikilink")

## Comments

Aggressive, portable.

These guys can stack up to three deep, and, as wielders, they can do
some damage if allowed multiple rounds of combat.

One of them should be holding the [iron key with dried
blood](Iron_Key_With_Dried_Blood.md "wikilink"), which you will need to
progress to the two gear mobs beyond.

## Directions

Get to Healing Springs by (for example) pp Dirk Chivers, s, 4e, 3n, 2e.
Then dip below the Springs to the hidden rock: e, 2n, e, 2d, 5w, 2s.
Open the hidden door: open w, 2w, n.
