and scratches his chin with a skeletal arm while evaluating you. Seeing
you stare at the arm, he puts it out of the view.*

## Comments

Ruddloaf is a corpse animator, as can be determined from his
description. He is also huge, sanced, and hits brutally hard (especially
in Eragora's lower-AC climate).

Just... beware.

If you simply walk into his room, he is not aggressive, and is in fact
involved in [Chattering Skeletal Claws
Quest](Chattering_Skeletal_Claws_Quest "wikilink"), as well as maybe
some more.

Ruddloaf will disappear if you enter his room with the insignia End of a
Well Seasoned Nightmare (until you leave the area)
