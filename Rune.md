*Using this [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink"), a
[Wizard](:Category:_Wizards.md "wikilink") could inscribe upon
[weapons](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") mystic runes, creating
various effects. Unfortunately, the process is quite unpredictable, and
every [item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") accepts runes
differently. The [spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") is difficult
to master. Those [Wizards](:Category:_Wizards.md "wikilink") with less
than 21 [wisdom](Wisdom.md "wikilink") will be unable to
[cast](Cast.md "wikilink"). The delve argument can offer some insight
into which runes do what on any given
[item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink"), but can sometimes harm the
[item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink"). Runes cannot be removed once
inscribed. Valid runes for [weapons](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink")
are: ka, yal, vi, rin, boh, chy, era, to, nol, zor.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'rune'

Rune is a spell which can only be learned by
[Wizards](:Category:Wizards.md "wikilink") who read the [Rune
Spellbook](Rune_Spellbook "wikilink").

It cannot be cast on a weapon that has been sharpened, poisoned, or has
a natural ac modifier. Thrown weapons are different than weapons and
cannot be runed. Once a weapon has been runed it cannot be sharpened.

Lowmort level weapons can be runed once (-10). Hero weapons can be runed
twice (-15). Lord weapons can be runed 3 times (-18).

When you cast rune, you can either specify a rune to imprint upon the
weapon, or you can delve the weapon. Delving will give you some insight
into what effect the different runes will have upon this specific
weapon, but be aware that delve can return false results. Also note that
delving can permanently lower the maximum hit points of a weapon, while
imprinting a rune will sometimes raise the level of the weapon.

The runes you can imprint upon a weapon are: ka yal vi rin boh chy era
to nol zor.

When a rune character is imprinted upon a weapon, it can become one of
the following:

**Rune of Battle**: -3 ac, increased min & avg damage  
**Rune of Defense**: -5 ac  
**Rune of Invulnerability**: -10 ac  
**Rune of Sickliness**: -2 con  
**Rune of Confusion**: -2 wis  
**Rune of Weakness**: -5 dr  
**Rune of Striking**: increased min & avg damage  
**Rune of Vanquishing**: increased min, avg, & max damage<sup>1</sup>  
Note that it's also possible for a rune to have no effect on a weapon.

If you'd like to spoil the fun of figuring out how rune works for
yourself, you can check out this [Rune Chart](Rune_Chart "wikilink").

<sup>1</sup> This rune will only increase the maximum damage on weapons
whose maximum damage is greater than their minimum damage.
