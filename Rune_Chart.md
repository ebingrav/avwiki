Different weapons accept the same [Runes](Rune "wikilink") differently.
Even two different copies of the same item might react to
[Runes](Rune "wikilink") differently.

However, any weapon that accepts [Runes](Rune "wikilink") will accept
them in one of ten ways. Which set of runes any weapon accepts is
randomly determined when the item pops. So, to determine what
[Runes](Rune "wikilink") will have a desired affect on any given weapon,
first delve the item a couple times to see which set of runes you're
dealing with. Once you figure out which one of the ten sets of
[Runes](Rune "wikilink") this weapon is accepting, you can safely
[Rune](Rune "wikilink") the item without fear of accidentally applying
the wrong [Rune](Rune "wikilink").

NB: The reason you delve twice is twofold; firstly, delve is not 100%
accurate so it is helpful to be more certain. Secondly, if you get a
result of 'runeword will have no affect' then you will need to delve
again because each runeword does nothing in two sets. (example; if delve
tells you 'yal' does nothing, your weapon might be in set 1 or 7)

<big>**Rune Chart**</big>

-   Rune of Striking is superior in raising minimum and average damage
    of a weapon to the Rune of Battle, by approximately 5-7 points to
    minimum and 3-5 points to average damage - tested on hero weapons,
    the range for lord weapons will likely be greater.
-   Rune of Vanquishing will not add max to a weapon that is too low
    level. On low-mortal weapons below level 25, the max does not
    increase (6-18 changes to 9-18). On low-mortal weapons above level
    25, but below Hero level, the max increases by 1. On Hero weapons it
    adds 2 max, and on Lord weapons it adds 4.
