Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to your god. The god may reward you for the
sacrifice. The nature of the reward depends upon your sacrifice. If you
are a worshipper, you may actually be heard and receive a response from
your god in the form of a spell. Gods are fickle beings, however, and
although they may reward you...they may also punish you for unknown
reasons. If your god does not respond, however, the Daemon Snikt shall
give you some gold for your trouble.
