*Saeren the King is a middle-aged man. He sits upon his throne, torches
blazing around him. He has very little in the way of gold or jewelry,
though he has a gold and silver amulet hung from his neck. His face,
though drawn with lines of stress, has a happy look to it.*

## Comments

Saeren is fairly big for his level and sanced.  
He also casts [Desiccate](Desiccate "wikilink"), so a warning to low HP
characters attempting to kill this mob.
