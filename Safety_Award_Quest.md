This quest is given by [Pilgrim](Pilgrim "wikilink") to all heroes. The
quest is group-based, so it only needs to be done once for all the group
members to get the reward.

The insignia will grant a weekly boost of +5% XP to all completing it.

Walkthrough:

-   Gather a regular party.
-   Once on Eragora proper, teleport to [Ginormous
    Dingersen](Ginormous_Dingersen "wikilink"), go w, and follow
    [Mayflower](Mayflower "wikilink").
-   Once dumped into the air room, move down to enter area proper.
    Consult [map](Exploration_Outpost_Map "wikilink") on directions how
    to navigate the area.

The goal is to kill as many fish, eels and turtles as fast as possible
(condors and kelp do not help). When an appropriate number of fish, eels
and turtles are killed (usually 50% of the mobs cleared), sharks will
start to have a random chance to kspawn on their death.

Killing a shark has 15% chance to spawn the mega-shark ("a hungry
megalodon"). This will be announced to the group with bright bold
letters. The shark will spawn in the room called "A Crimson Stretch of
the Ulexite Forest", which is d, 3w, d from the drop-zone where you
started.

-   Locate the mega-shark after the announcement and kill it. Another
    announcement will appear stating you are to return to Pilgrim and
    claim the reward.
-   After the run, portal to Pilgrim, and have every group member tell
    pilgrim reward to gain the [Safety Award
    Insignia](Safety_Award_Insignia "wikilink").
