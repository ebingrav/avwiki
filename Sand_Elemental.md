*Sand twirls and flies all around you, making it hard to see and breath.
Suddenly the sand takes on a shape, and you make out a huge torso, then
arms followed by legs and finally a head appears.  
The creature is made out of sand, yet it seems solid and very powerful.
Its face has no distinguishable features other than three red malevolent
eyes that glare at you.  
You have disturbed a sand elemental, and you will pay for that with your
life.*
