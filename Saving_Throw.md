''Saving throw determines how resistant you are to spells cast on you.
The lower the number (bigger negative numbers) the more resistant you
are.

*A saving throw does not mean you're invulnerable to damage spells, but
it can help to reduce the damage somewhat. There exist some protective
spells which can improve your saving throw; for example,
[bless](Bless.md "wikilink") gives a slight boost.
[Equipment](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") can also sometimes [improve
your saving throw](:Category:_Saving-Throw_Gear.md "wikilink").*

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may view their saving
throw using their [score](Score.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink").
