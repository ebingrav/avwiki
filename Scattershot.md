*Upon executing this [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"), the
[archer](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink")'s next shot will be a loose
flurry of scarcely-aimed [arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink"). The
more in the [room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") at the time, the
greater the odds these [arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink") will
find useful targets. Due to the looseness with which they are fired,
each individual arrow will do less damage than it would normally.
[Archers](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink") can specify the number of
[arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink") they wish to fire, up to a
limit determined by [level](Level.md "wikilink") and
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") percentage. If the
[archer](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink") is in direct combat,
scattershot will only hit the direct opponent and the maximum number of
[arrows](:Category:_Arrows.md "wikilink") will be reduced.*

Prerequisite(s): [Longshot](Longshot.md "wikilink").

Syntax: scattershot <number>.
