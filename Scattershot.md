*Upon executing this [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink"), the
[archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink")'s next shot will be a loose
flurry of scarcely-aimed [arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink"). The
more in the [room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink") at the time, the greater
the odds these [arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink") will find useful
targets. Due to the looseness with which they are fired, each individual
arrow will do less damage than it would normally.
[Archers](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") can specify the number of
[arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink") they wish to fire, up to a limit
determined by [level](Level "wikilink") and
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") percentage. If the
[archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") is in direct combat, scattershot
will only hit the direct opponent and the maximum number of
[arrows](:Category:_Arrows "wikilink") will be reduced.*

Prerequisite(s): [Longshot](Longshot "wikilink").

Syntax: scattershot <number>.
