## Directions

**[Area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"):** [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:_Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink")
([Map](Highways/Great_Wall_Map.md "wikilink")).  
The scavenger [wanders](Wandering_Mobs.md "wikilink"), but it's usually
found on the path around Solace, or on Old East Road and Woodbridge
Road.  
The scavenger is portable, but there are multiple scavengers in the
game, and you may wind up in the wrong place.
