*The features of this man are set into a thoughtful frown. Keeping his
eyes on the dangerous surroundings with the blurred but non-faltering
attention of the experienced stalker he is able to focus his mind on
larger puzzle of this place. Noticing you right away he still lets some
time drift past before saying with the hoarse voice of someone who has
not broken silence for a long time.*
