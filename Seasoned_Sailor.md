### Comments

Sailors assist, and at a rather high alignment. Only the wholly angelic
are safe from their briny wrath.

A Seasoned Sailor, [an Officer of Lord
Audis](Officer_Of_Lord_Audis.md "wikilink"), [a Hired
Soldier](Hired_Solider.md "wikilink"), [a Professional
Warrior](Professional_Warrior.md "wikilink"), and [a Paid
Mercenary](Paid_Mercenary.md "wikilink") are the most easily accessible
xp mobs in Gorn's Anchor. Two of each (except for sailors, of which
there are four) patrol the dock.

Three of the sailors are level 42. The one reading off of a checklist is
level 45.
