*The unnaturally grey skinned ancient looking halfling, heavily scented
with embalming fluid, raises his head from a large scroll and regards
you coldly. His features are nearly sekeltal, but fire still burns in
his eyes, betraying the icy demeanor he projects.*

## Comments

Seneca is a common portal point should you wish to access either the
infirmary room just 1s from him, or to go deeper into the area's bowels.

He doesn't hit as hard as some other Eragoran bosses but is big and will
heal himself.

Seneca is involved in [End Of A Well Seasoned Nightmare
Quest](End_Of_A_Well_Seasoned_Nightmare_Quest "wikilink"), and perhaps
some more.
