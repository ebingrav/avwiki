There appear to be at least three different versions of this insignia,
being;

-   Sept Kwa'Xulu Agent
-   Sept Kwa'Xulu Operative
-   Sept Kwa'Xulu Traitor

All seem to be related to the [Septarch Animosity
Quest](Septarch_Animosity_Quest "wikilink"), and rewards also seem to
vary, but include the [Drow Headdress](Drow_Headdress "wikilink") or
various enhancers on the insignia itself. These include;

-   0 to 5% to experience gain.
-   0 to -10 AC.
-   0 to +3 to damage.
-   0 to +3 to hit.
-   10% protection against duegar
-   0 to 10% hp regeneration rate

The exact combination is dependent of the path (operative or agent,
traitor gives none), character level (the lower the better bonuses) and
a great deal of random chance.

Completing the quest at hero 999 and hero 437 (not for the first time)
yielded no headdress and

`   Sept Kwa'Xulu Operative`  
`     Modifies protection from duergars by 5% continuous`  
`     Modifies armor class by -3 continuous`  
`     Modifies experience gain by + 1% continuous`

With a hero 2 using the same process, the reward was no headdress plus

`   Sept Kwa'Xulu Operative`  
`     Modifies experience gain by + 3% continuous`  
`     Modifies armor class by -5 continuous`  
`     Modifies protection from duergars by 10% continuous`

With a hero 110 using the same process, the reward was the headdress
plus the insignia (but with no modifiers). Ditto for a hero 50 and a
lowmort 8 completing this for the first time.
