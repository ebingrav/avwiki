There seem to be two versions of this insignia, being;

-   Sept N'Tel'Sha Master Spy
-   Sept N'Tel'Sha Retainer

The *Retainer* is gained through the [Septarch Spite
Quest](Septarch_Spite_Quest "wikilink") and seems incompatable with
later versions of this insignia and also any of the [Sept Kwa'Xulu
Insignia](Sept_Kwa'Xulu_Insignia "wikilink").

The *Master Spy* is gained through a variation of the [Septarch
Animosity Quest](Septarch_Animosity_Quest "wikilink") and includes
various enhancers to the insignia itself. These include;

-   0 to 5% to experience gain.
-   0 to -10 AC.
-   0 to +3 to damage.
-   0 to +3 to hit.
-   10% protection against duegar
-   0 to 10% hp regeneration rate

The exact combination is partially dependent of the path (master spy or
agent, traitor gives none), character level (the lower the better
bonuses) and a great deal of random chance.

For a hero 2 first-time quest completer, "Master Spy" gives is +10%
protection from duergar, -5 ac, +3% xp. For another hero 2 first time
completer at 8am/9am, it yielded +5% hp regen, 2/2 hr dr. For a hero 298
first time quest completer, "Master Spy" gives +5% protection duergar,
-3 ac, +1% xp. A level 48 and 24 (second time completing, first
incarnation and second) lowmort received +3 hr/+3 dr/+10% hp regen. Yet
another hero 2 first-time quest completer (for this incarnation) at 7pm
got +10% protection for duergar, -5 ac, +3% xp.

A hero 999 and 957 received +3% hp regen, +1/+1 hr/dr.
