*The son of Septarch Kwa'Xulu, Kyxial rose to this position by simple
fact of being the most powerful surviving mage at the conclusion of the
Drow-Duergar War. He has thrown himself into the role of teacher and
loremaster for the new drow nation, determined that superior knowledge
and magical might will make Tiureess a centre of power for the future.
His roll as an educator, and in some cases a re-educator, has already
begun to show results.*

*He is also known to love puzzles. If you know of any, he would be bound
to show an interest.*
