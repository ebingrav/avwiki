*The erstwhile Matron Mother of House Kwa'Xulu, she was one of the few
nobles to escape the fall of the Drow City to the hands of the duergar.
The driving force behind the sweeping changes which have revolutionised
the drow culture and brought them to the surface, now she is content to
serve in an administrative role as head of Sept Kwa'Xulu.*

*Still a powerful looking woman with striking red eyes and lustrous
silver hair, her dark skin shines like polished ebony. Quite the regal
figure, it is hard to imagine attracting her attention with anything
other falling to your knees before her and grovelling. Maybe you should
try.*
