*Note*: The quest has recently been fixed so that Septarch Animosity
will also give the player an insignia, [Kwa'Xulu
Operative](Sept_Kwa'Xulu_Insignia "wikilink"), should the quest be
completed in the manner presented.

There are at least three known variations to the conclusion, all with
different insignia, and very different awards (bonus bearing insignia).

The quest itself, along with its insignia (whichever the player
receives) will fade in one week so the quest can be retried.

Actions which have no effect:

-   Yodel in Spite's room
-   Say first phrase in Spite's room
-   Say first counterphase in Spite's room AFTER saying it to Animosity
-   Rose in Spite's room
-   Say second phrase in Spite's room
-   Say second counterphrase in Spite's room AFTER saying it to
    Animosity

Actions which may have an effect:

-   Say second counterphrase in Spite's room BEFORE visiting Animosity.
    This gives insignia "Sept N'Tel'Sha Master Spy" (one of the [Sept
    N'Tel'Sha Insignia](Sept_N'Tel'Sha_Insignia "wikilink") (and no
    Kwa'Xulu insignia).
-   Say first counterphrase in Spite's room BEFORE visiting Animosity --
    This produces an amethyst. Returning to Animosity and saying the
    counterphrase afterwards yields the insignia "Sept Kwa'Xulu Traitor"
    with no modifiers and no reward, and ends the quest, and she attacks
    you.
