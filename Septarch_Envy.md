*A woman wearing a number of hats, and not all of them comfortably,
Septarch Envy has been given the somewhat vague task of caring for the
wellbeing, health and propagation of the drow race. As a reformed
priestess of Lolth who now oversees the adoption of the worship of
Shizaga, she walks the thin line between being useless and being too
powerful. The other Septarchs will not tolerate anything which smells of
clerical domination of their society again. In amongst this, the
Septarch has begun to have some unorthodox ideas. It remains to be seen
whether or not these get her into trouble, or secure her position.*

*With all these worries, she has little time to look after the artistic
section of her Sept and generally lets the arts types get on with
whatever they want. Her major flaw is her ego, and she loves praise and
applause. Perhaps you should give her some for her stirling efforts.*
