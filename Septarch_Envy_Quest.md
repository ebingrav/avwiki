Perform the following:

-   c tele [Septarch Envy](Septarch_Envy "wikilink")
-   applaud envy
-   c tele drow informer
-   kill informer
-   get finger
-   c tele sept envy
-   give finger envy
-   c tele athartis
-   drop baby (evil path) or give baby kirkan (good path)
-   c tele sept envy
-   applaud envy
-   receive [Small Ruby Ring](Small_Ruby_Ring "wikilink") and align set
    to -1000
-   receive insignia ['Sept Xkra'Zvim
    Retainer'](Sept_Xkra'Zvim_Insignia.md "wikilink")

*Note*: there is more than one way to complete this quest - this is just
one way. Another will earn you ['Sept Xkra'Zvim
Do-Gooder'](Sept_Xkra'Zvim_Do-Gooder.md "wikilink"). This involves
handing the baby over to Kirkan instead of dropping it on the ground.
This will get you an amethyst and an imm-level bless.

Known variations will offer different rewards (instead of the ring) such
as an actual [Roixa](Roixa "wikilink")'s blessing, with different
insignia.

Once completed, the quest cannot be retried easily. There is a way to
repeat the quest for a different version of the [Sept Xkra'Zvim
Insignia](Sept_Xkra'Zvim_Insignia "wikilink"), or to repeat for a second
reward. However, this seems to be a once per reboot option, which unless
you really want another [ring](Small_Ruby_Ring.md "wikilink") is
probably not worth it. Though it can be a good way to get your align
down real fast, for evil players.
