If you give this item to [Rietta](Rietta "wikilink"), she tells you the
following (and gives it back):

''Rietta says, "This barb comes from the tentacle of a
[Bloodmaw](Bloodmaw "wikilink") if I'm not mistaken. The beast has many
long tentacles, each with its own mouth on the end, so few of its
victims ever see it face to face. In order to get it to surface, one has
to lop off enough tentacles to get its attention."'

*She hands the barb back to you, "Not that I'd reccomend that, of
course. If you get yourself devoured don't go moping around the
after-life saying [Lady Rietta](Rietta "wikilink") told you to attack a
[Bloodmaw](Bloodmaw "wikilink")."*
