*Seven rods of rare starmetal have been etched with holy runes, and
chained together with short links of the same material. Hanging from
your hand it could resemble a staff, but with a flick of the wrist it
would act like a whip. A glorious weapon of hidden and secret power, it
is not for unskilled hands.*

## Comments

Result of the [Restoring Mark V (Part 1)
Quest](Restoring_Mark_V_(Part_1)_Quest "wikilink").

Please note:

-   Full name of the item is "Serpent's Tongue, the nine-section whip".
-   This is chain weapon that does whipping damage.
-   As a chain weapon it's likely most suitable for wartype classes that
    get both [Double Hit](Double_Hit "wikilink") and
    [Disarm](Disarm "wikilink").
-   It comes already pre-"sharpened" (whips usually cannot be
    sharpened), pre-runed, and preset to level 55. All you have to do is
    insure it.
-   You won't get another.
-   Do not lose it (**ever**, even if archer), as it is key to the
    [Restoring Mark V (Part 2)
    Quest](Restoring_Mark_V_(Part_2)_Quest "wikilink").
