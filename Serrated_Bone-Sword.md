## Comments

The two swords are on the two captains -
[Gruppy](Captain_Gruppy.md "wikilink") is on the *Sea King*,
[Tyrana](Captain_Tyrana.md "wikilink") is on the *Sea Queen*. Both ships
have 7 tough sailors as well as the captian, all are aggressive and see
through hidden or invisible. If you are a superhero area caster you will
probably be able to clear them all, if not target the captain and
calm/teleport after getting the sword.

-   -   I think they made these rooms easier, last time there was like 4
        veteran fisherman instead of the 7 tough sailors.
