Syntax: setmin <entrance message> Syntax: setmin reset Syntax: setmout
<exit message> Syntax: setmout reset

Setmin/setmout allows a player over level 35 to specify messages that
are displayed when moving between rooms. The player's name is
automatically shown at the beginning, and a direction is shown at the
end.

For example, assume your name is Caveman. Typing "setmin drags his
knuckles in from" would result in: "Caveman drags his knuckles in from
the east" (or west, or "from above"). In the same way, typing "setmout
leaves, dragging his knuckles" would show: "Caveman leaves, dragging his
knuckles east."

Notice that the word "the" before the direction is handled
automatically. That is, entering from the east shows "Caveman drags his
knuckles in from the east", where entering from above shows "Caveman
drags his knuckles in from above".

Setmin/setmout by themselves display the current message. Placing a
'reset' by itself after setmin or setmout resets them to default.

Please don't make setmins or setmouts that are rude, vulgar or
suggestive.
