## Comments

Carried by [Ferromancer Sturmiet](Ferromancer_Sturmiet "wikilink"), an
aggressive mob of race "cloud giant" who casts stormlord spells and
hangs out in the very bottom of the forge in the water rooms with the
slagbeasts and the corpse-eating slagslugs.

Used to obtain the [Scorched Giant
Skull](Scorched_Giant_Skull "wikilink") in [White Raven Alighting
Unseen](White_Raven_Alighting_Unseen "wikilink")'s room, "Against sheer
mesa cliffs". If you drop this in this room, it becomes furniture which
stays in the room until reboot and cannot be picked up, and White Raven
tells you to light a fire:

` White Raven Alighting Unseen says 'A worthy sacrifice, though the gods`  
` who once dwelled here are either dead or gone.'`  
` `  
` White Raven Alighting Unseen says 'I suspect you will have to light the`  
` offering pyre yourself.'`

The next step in this quest involves dropping a [Heart of
Fire](Heart_of_Fire "wikilink"). Something similar can be done with the
[Strip of Burnt, Tattooed
Flesh](Strip_of_Burnt,_Tattooed_Flesh "wikilink"). The room only seems
to accommodate one of these items on the ground as furniture at a time.
(If one item has already been dropped, dropping the other will not make
it into furniture in the room).

If you try giving the item to White Raven instead of dropping it, he
will give it back with a clue:

` White Raven Alighting Unseen says 'I recognize this sort of work. It's a`  
` very crude method of extracting a soul. I want nothing to do with it,`  
` personally, but you may find some lingering power within it still.'`
