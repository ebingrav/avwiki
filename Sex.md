This field indicates a [character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink")'s
sex, which may be either male or female or neuter; its effects are
merely cosmetic.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") were once able to change
sex using a '[change sex](Change_Sex "wikilink")'
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink"); however, this
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") has been disabled.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") who draw a card from a
[Deck of Many Things](Decks_Of_Many_Things "wikilink") may potentially
experience a "painful operation" that will permanently change their
respective sex; at present, there is no other way to change a
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink")'s sex after creation.
