This field indicates a
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink")'s sex, which may be
either male or female or neuter; its effects are merely cosmetic.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") were once able to
change sex using a '[change sex](Change_Sex.md "wikilink")'
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink"); however, this
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") has been disabled.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") who draw a card from a
[Deck of Many Things](Decks_Of_Many_Things.md "wikilink") may
potentially experience a "painful operation" that will permanently
change their respective sex; at present, there is no other way to change
a [character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink")'s sex after creation.
