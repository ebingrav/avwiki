*This young apprentice of the Mystagogue devoted his entire life to the
Dark Fae Queen, Zydarielle. In a moment of extreme loyalty, Ma'Klyn
offered his life and his soul to his Queen. She was impressed by his
devotion, and cast a spell of enchantment on him, which spread
throughout the shrine. The enchantment encased each individual, and that
small remnant of power preserved part of themselves. Their shades are
condemned to wander the shrine for eternity. Whether the Queen meant to
create the shades in her evil ways, or if she misjudged what these weak
mortals could withstand is unknown. However, this shade is less faded
than the rest, and his power is still great!*
