*The dragon so old that Midgaardia has lost records of his name, he was
one of the first children of Tiamat, dark as night, lord of the shadows,
the Moon Hunter. Perished long before the giants lost their wits,
millenia have passed as his body and spirit lay entombed within these
halls. You are not worthy to gaze upon him, something to be rectified
immediately.*

## Comments

This mob is a black dragon, so will use acid breath and tail. On the
most common route to this mob the previous room will drain all your
mana. There are two (locked) exits to this room - the throne down and
the hatch south. The hatch can be bashed open and the throne can be
opened via interaction. There are at least three ways to get to this
room.
