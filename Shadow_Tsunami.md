    1 'SHADOW TSUNAMI'
    syntax:   qi tsunami <target>

    The Shadow Tsunami is the Lord Shadowfist's ultimate weapon.
    It can inflict truly terrible damage on an opponent depending on how
    much Outer Qi the user has at his disposal.  Be warned though, use
    of this technique will leave you prone and bleeding.

    This ability will consume all Outer Qi that you have accumulated,
    and it cannot be used with any less than 10.  Like its predecessors,
    Shadow Tsunami causes cursed damage.

## Comments

using 12 outer qi results in fair damage, a 50% loss of hp, and 12 ticks
of lag.

    You are left in a daze as you unleash a Shadow Tsunami upon Arcanadaemon!

    You shadow tsunami Arcanadaemon with >>***VAPORIZING***<< brutality!
