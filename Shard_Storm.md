1 'SHARD STORM' Syntax: cast 'shard storm' (area spell) Prerequisites:
none

Shard storm conjures a metallic sphere, which then erupts into a wild
spray of jagged shards. The damage done by these shards depends on the
armor of the victims. Those with very low armor take considerably more
damage. Those with high armor may take none at all. This is a spell
which is primarily for the benefit of mobs. Since mobs have very high
hp, the damage it does to them is relatively little even if they're
naked. But it can seriously hurt less-armoured casters like

Shard Storm is a lost art. None teach it, but rumors circulate that
[spellbooks](:Category:Spellbooks.md "wikilink") of Shard Storm still
exist.
