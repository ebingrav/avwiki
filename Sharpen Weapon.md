*By sharpening your [weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink"), you
increase the [minimum damage](Melee_Weapon_Values "wikilink") that it
does, thus increasing the overall average damage. The more you sharpen a
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink"), the less your [minimum
damage](Melee_Weapon_Values "wikilink") will go up. There are also many
things that can happen to your [weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink")
while you are sharpening it. If you get lucky, one of your sharpening
attempts may increase the [maximum
damage](Melee_Weapon_Values "wikilink") on your
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") as well as the [minimum
damage](Melee_Weapon_Values "wikilink"). If you try to sharpen it too
much, the [weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") may shatter and be
lost in a scattering of metal shards. If you slip errantly with your
[whetstone](Whetstone "wikilink"), you may end up
[dulling](Dulling "wikilink") your
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") and setting its [minimum
damage](Melee_Weapon_Values "wikilink") back to the original number.
[Dulling](Dulling "wikilink") may also remove
[enchants](Enchant_Weapon "wikilink") that have been placed upon the
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") prior to it being sharpened. You
can get a decent idea of a [weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink")'s
condition by [examining](Examine "wikilink") or
[identifying](Identify_(spell) "wikilink") it, which will allow you to
determine how many times you could realistically sharpen a
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") before reaching its peak
sharpness. You will, of course, need a [whetstone](Whetstone "wikilink")
to sharpen your [weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") with.*

Prerequisite(s): [Weapon Lore](Weapon_Lore "wikilink").
