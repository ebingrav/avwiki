*By sharpening your [weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink"), you
increase the [minimum damage](Melee_Weapon_Values.md "wikilink") that it
does, thus increasing the overall average damage. The more you sharpen a
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink"), the less your [minimum
damage](Melee_Weapon_Values.md "wikilink") will go up. There are also
many things that can happen to your
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") while you are sharpening it.
If you get lucky, one of your sharpening attempts may increase the
[maximum damage](Melee_Weapon_Values.md "wikilink") on your
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") as well as the [minimum
damage](Melee_Weapon_Values.md "wikilink"). If you try to sharpen it too
much, the [weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") may shatter and be
lost in a scattering of metal shards. If you slip errantly with your
[whetstone](Whetstone.md "wikilink"), you may end up
[dulling](Dulling.md "wikilink") your
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") and setting its [minimum
damage](Melee_Weapon_Values.md "wikilink") back to the original number.
[Dulling](Dulling.md "wikilink") may also remove
[enchants](Enchant_Weapon.md "wikilink") that have been placed upon the
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") prior to it being sharpened.
You can get a decent idea of a
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink")'s condition by
[examining](Examine.md "wikilink") or
[identifying](Identify_(spell).md "wikilink") it, which will allow you
to determine how many times you could realistically sharpen a
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") before reaching its peak
sharpness. You will, of course, need a
[whetstone](Whetstone.md "wikilink") to sharpen your
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") with.*

Prerequisite(s): [Weapon Lore](Weapon_Lore.md "wikilink").
