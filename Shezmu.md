Hopefully, it's not too arrogant to create my own page on the Wiki.

I've been an Immortal since early 2010, but have been around AVATAR
since early 1998/late 1997 era. I came to AVATAR after my old BBS "The
Rock Garden" shut down. That BBS had a simple, stock MUD, "Major MUD".
If I recall correctly, there were only four classes, five races to
choose from. The codebase was very simple and prone to crashing. I was
usually the only player logged on. I think the largest group I ever saw
there was three people.

I'm willing to help anyone, at just about anytime. Feel free to send me
a tell. I can also be reached by email at Shezmu at outland dot org.

    Request Team Liaison, Staff gopher, demonic god of execution, slaughter,
    and red wine.

    From http://egyptian-gods.org/egyptian-gods-shezmu/

    Shezmu (known by many spellings) was the ancient Egyptian demonic God of
    Slaughter, Execution, Blood and Wine. The color red of wine has a
    strong connection with blood, as Shezmu would rip off the heads of the
    wrongdoers and place their heads into a wine press to be crushed,
    turning the blood into red wine. Thus, he was known as "Lord of Blood",
    "Executioner of Osiris", "Slaughterer of Souls" and "Demon of the Wine Press".
    Besides being a punisher of wrongdoers, he also protects the virtuous ones.

    Like many of the gods of Ancient Egypt, Shezmu was of a complex nature. He
    had qualities of both light and darkness, but this was not the reason that
    he was known as a 'demon'. To the Egyptians, demons were not necessarily evil
    in nature. Often they were quite helpful.

    The person behind Shezmu is also of a complex nature. Quick to rebuke,
    equally quick to render assistance to any and all who ask for it.
