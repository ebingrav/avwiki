## Comments

A favorite tactic of many casters is to have two of these shields one
with a [Fire Ward](Fire-Ward_Flag "wikilink") and using [Charge
Shield](Charge_Shield "wikilink") charge it with flametongue for use
against single mobs, then one warded with [Lightning
Ward](Lightning-Ward_Flag "wikilink") and charged with arc lightning for
use against multiple mobs or when area surging. The added benefit of
double wards is that they raise the item's level, which in turns
increases the damage meted out by the spells charged to the shield. A
level 54 shield will do dismembering, while a 53 will do
\*\*\*DISEMBOWELING\*\*\*.

([Map](Shadow_Keep_Map "wikilink"))  
**[Mob(s)](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink"):** [Paladin's
Ghost](Paladin's_Ghost "wikilink")  
Portal to "rot cor" and walk northwest until you get to the waterfall.
There is an invis key in the pool, grab it and unlock north to get to
the invis Paladin's Ghost. Also, you can just bash the door in. You may
need to use an AoE spell to get him to show.
