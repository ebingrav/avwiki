The [Shield Of The Tree](Shield_Of_The_Tree "wikilink") is a difficult
quest in the [Transfigured Forest](Transfigured_Forest "wikilink"). It
is very hard to solo parts of the quest and will require several players
or several alts with different alignments/fighting styles.

You will need eight different items before you are ready to obtain the
shield.

Three can be found scattered around the area, in no fixed location.

<spoiler> Retrieve the following items:

-   [clump of stone](Clump_Of_Stone.md "wikilink")
-   [clump of leaves](Clump_Of_Leaves.md "wikilink")
-   [clump of ice](Clump_Of_Ice.md "wikilink")

These are scattered around on several mobs. The ice (by far the hardest
one to get) is in the "Ice Tree" section on a [Giant Creature Of
Ice](Giant_Creature_Of_Ice "wikilink") (A strange creature of ice stands
quietly among the branches), a level 82 [Frost
Giant](Frost_Giants.md "wikilink"), the leaves on a [Giant-Shaped Swirl
Of Leaves](Giant-Shaped_Swirl_Of_Leaves "wikilink") (A giant-shaped
swirl of half-decayed leaves drifts along), and the stone on a [Trunk Of
Stone](Trunk_Of_Stone "wikilink") (The stubby old trunk of a tree stands
here, grey as stone). There are several of each mob (three?). Kill all
of them in one pop for clump to re-spawn. </spoiler>

You will also need four items which will generally require four
different characters to gain.

<spoiler> You will also need to get one of <b>each</b> of the mana
items:

-   [Gnarled Branch Of Age](Gnarled_Branch_Of_Age "wikilink")
-   [Swirl Of Fumes](Swirl_Of_Fumes "wikilink")
-   [Grey Orb Of Stone](Grey_Orb_Of_Stone "wikilink")
-   [Crackling Sphere Of
    Lightning](Crackling_Sphere_Of_Lightning "wikilink")

Since each of these require a certain type of player to get you will
need a mix of good/melee, good/caster, evil/melee, evil/caster.
</spoiler>

After you have all these items get started by getting the
[root](Glowing_Root.md "wikilink") in the secret tunnel (hidden west
exit in the shortcut to Ent). Give it to the [Heavily Scarred
Ent](Heavily_Scarred_Ent "wikilink") to begin the quest.

<spoiler> He will give you a new [glowing
root](Glowing_Root_(Transformed).md "wikilink"). You will then give the
new root to the [Vortex Of Souls](Vortex_Of_Souls "wikilink") which will
take it and the four mana items and give you a [glowing
seed](Glowing_Seed.md "wikilink"). Take the seed back to the scarred ent
and give it to him. He will take it and give you back [glowing
seed](Glowing_Seed_(Transformed).md "wikilink"). Give the seed back to
ent and he will take the three clumps and give you the [Shield Of The
Tree](Shield_Of_The_Tree "wikilink"). </spoiler>
