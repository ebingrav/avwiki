*One of the largest of all Riithi, this shinriith, a member of the
warrior caste, is well suited to his duties. Having trained his entire
life in the ways of war and combat, he's the epitome of fighting skill.
His large muscular frame fits tightly into the armored stone cuirass he
wears. His war helmet is of the same stony material and covers his
entire head, leaving only his nose and large ears exposed. The boots on
his feet are of similar make, and make a definite stone on stone sound
as he brandishes his wicked looking paired warclaws and advances toward
you.*
