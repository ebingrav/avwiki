*As the captain of the shinriith detachment of this expedition, this
member of the Riithi warrior caste takes his job seriously. Having led
raids against the duergar, svirfneblin, and other underground races, he
is well experienced in the type of combat one finds in the tight
confines of an underground passage. Clad in the same type of armor as
the rest of the shinriith here, his helmet is the only item that makes
him stand out. The long white unicorn tail mounted to the peak of his
helmet shines like a beacon in the darkness. Having seen that you were
able to get past the rest of the guards, he snarls, brandishes his
paired warclaws, and attacks!*

## Comments

The shinriith are especially strong, due to all the armor and weapons
they are wearing.  
  
The shinriith captain is especially problematic, because he is in a room
with three other highly armored, powerful mobs. If you are hero level,
consider going [Invis](Invis "wikilink") (they can't see due to the
level difference), and [Charm
Person](Charm_Person "wikilink")/[Domination](Domination "wikilink") the
mob you want to kill. Then either pull them into the adjacent room, or
order them to kill themselves by telling them to toss or trip
themselves. If the mob fails toss/trip, the mob will begin killing
itself.
