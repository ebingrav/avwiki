*This shinriith, one of the Riithi warrior caste, is charged with a most
sacred duty, to prevent anyone getting through the passage back to the
Home Caverns. Having trained his entire life for combat, he is the elite
of the shinriithi. His large frame is armored in a stony cuirass, with
matching boots and helmet, the latter covering his entire head except
his ears and nose. His size gives ample evidence of the ogre stock in
his ancestry. He snarls in righteous anger at your intrusion, and
advances on you, brandishing his dual warclaws.*
