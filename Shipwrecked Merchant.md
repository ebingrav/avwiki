*This merchant is standing here, frantically trying to figure out how to
get back the letter to [Lord Audis](Lord_Audis "wikilink") that was
stolen from him as he lay sleeping on the beach after he washed ashore.
His clothing was obviously of superb quality, and definitely looks worse
for his recent experiences. He suddenly announces that he will reward
handsomely anyone who can get the letter and return it to him intact.*
