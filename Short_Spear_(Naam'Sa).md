It will return when thrown, if it hits.

`It will cease to be when thrown, if it missess.`  
`It delivers poison very well.`

This one doesn't always land poison but does lots of damage. These are
hard to get so be careful. Also, be ready to get it off of corpse in
case mob catches it. Found on the warriors below ground. The one on
regular Naam'sa Warriors is weight 8. The one on [Massive Naam'sa
Warrior](Massive_Naam'sa_Warrior "wikilink") and [Tean
NaamAhn'Sa](Tean_NaamAhn'Sa "wikilink") is weight 9, already poisoned
([venom](:Category:Venom.md "wikilink")) and delivers poison better. The
regular warriors are much easier to kill than Tean. The already poisoned
spears must be re-poisoned for use, and keep in mind that they have to
be re-poisoned again after a single successful delivery.
