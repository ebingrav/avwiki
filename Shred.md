-   Prerequisites: none
-   Syntax:
    -   extend
    -   retract

With the shred skill, Rippers learn to maximize the power of their
racial claws. When extended, the claws are used as primary weapons,
instead of a randomly occurring extra attack, and gain a significant
damage boost.

Rippers can use the extend command to ready their claws for combat and
the retract command to put them away if they want to wield traditional
weapons or attend a tea party.

This skill or any skill that lists it as a prerequisite is not available
out of class under any circumstances.

Shred allows a Ripper to extend their claws, which are m56 (at hero)
non-removable weapons wielded and offhanded by the Ripper.

At hero, shred also provides a +20 HR and +20 DR bonus.
