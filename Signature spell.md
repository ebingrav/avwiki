    Syntax: cast 'signature spell' create
            cast 'signature spell' rename "Custom Spell Name"

    Sufficiently powerful wizards should visit Kasiveer on Thorngate. He is eager to those so qualified to create their very own signature spell!

    Visiting him at the required level will grant you a basic version of this spell. Once you have this learned you can then give him the following items to tailor your spell (one at a time, one choice from each section):

    Target options:
    Fireheart              single target spell (default)
    Widow Tear             area damage spell

    Damage type options:
    Diamond                Arcane damage (default)
    Fizora                 Fire damage
    Citrine gem            Electric damage
    Emerald                Chemical damage
    Aquamarine             Water damage
    Moonstone              Cold damage
    Any perfect gem        Sonic damage

    Once you have modified (or learned your spell for the first time) you must create it. See syntax above. You can also chose to rename your spell. Please be advised standard object naming guidelines apply. See HELP CHRISTEN.

    Single target signature spells have a chance of blinding victims.
