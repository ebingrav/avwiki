If you give this to the [Weaver Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink") she
will tell you the following story about [Baronness
Kipparielle](Baronness_Kipparielle "wikilink"):

*The Mother Weaver sighs, "The young Baroness. Do not let her appearance
fool you. She takes the form of a child but is as old as any other Great
Fae, and her power is considerable. She is a master of many forms of
magic, and still a greater master of mischief. Few in history have
rivaled Kippy as a sewer of discord. Some even credit her with planting
the seeds of discontent that led the Queen to betray the King; the very
Sundering of Fae, all those millennia ago. Whether this is true or not,
even I cannot say. Everywhere she goes and everything she does is
shrouded in chaos and disarray that not even my wisdom can untangle."*
