If you give this to the [Weaver Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink") she
will tell you the following story about [Grand Duke
Malafont](Grand_Duke_Malafont "wikilink"):

*"Malafont. The original Grand Duke. He became the Queen's lover after
the Fae began to war amongst themselves, and was so adept at the art of
warfare that few doubted he would lead the Dark Fae armies to victory
over Adrial's forces on every plane save perhaps Adrial's own. Many
coveted his position as General of the Army of the Night, but the only
one who could actually hope to defeat him, Yorimandil, had no desire to
rule.*

*Perhaps nobody wished to usurp Malafont more than his own son,
Zarradyn. Unfortunately he was also in the best position to do so, and
he slew his father as he slept, taking the title of Duke and command of
the armies of Noctopia. Alas for Zarradyn, he was not the tactician his
father was, and he began to lose battle after battle, finally agreeing
to peace with Adrial after the death of his own mother at the final
battle of Avalon."*
