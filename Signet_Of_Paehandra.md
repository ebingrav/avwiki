If you give this to the [Weaver Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink") she
will tell you the following story about [Paehandra Of The
Moon](Paehandra_Of_The_Moon "wikilink"):

*"Before the High Drow fell to worshipping the spider demon, both High
Sylvan peoples had a similar religion. Rather than worship any one
deity, they instead would venerate their Fae ancestors. They would pray
to Valyce for a mild winter, Manon for a prosperous spring, and so on.
None had more celebrants than Pascilon and his sister, Paehandra; the
sun and the moon. Gentle and peaceful, they were the high priests and
the objects of the very earliest of religious devotions.*

*But the Queen took Paehandra's ear. Did not the moon deserve more
worship than the sun? Ought it not have more time in the sky? After all,
the beauty of the moon far exceeded that of the harsh, glare her brother
favored. Should she not have the greater following?*

*And so Paehandra grew bitter; Every sunrise, every High Elf that bowed
to her brother twisted her heart. The very last time she and her brother
met, on a day which had once been a festival of the Sun and Moon, she
left him dead with a knife in his throat. So it was the very gentlest of
the Great Fae was the very first to draw blood.*

*The Fae were Sundered, and would never again have unity until the Great
26 were reduced to 3."*
