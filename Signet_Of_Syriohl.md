If you give this to the [Weaver Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink") she
will tell you the following story about [Syriohl Of The
Autumn](Syriohl_Of_The_Autumn "wikilink"):

*The Mother Weaver seems momentarily distracted, but then says, "The
Fall. Death. Decay. The unmaking and the unraveling of living things.
These things were always the delight of Syriohl,lover of Valyce, servant
of Zydarielle. And appropriately, he is perhaps the perfect example to
understand the fall of the Dark Fae to evil. In the beginning, Syriohl
was content for Autumn to come in its time; for life to end and decay
with the turning of the years. But the words of the Queen goaded him
towards an insistence that decay and death always be victorious. Every
summer when Janidor danced in the fields Syriohl's fury grew. It was no
longer part of the cycle for him, it was a defeat. A defeat that would
be paid back savagely when his chance came. He began to loathe Janidor
Summerling, and took his sadistic time in killing him when they faced at
the Battle of Four Seasons. Alas for Syriohl, in the end, the Spring
would have the final victory."*
