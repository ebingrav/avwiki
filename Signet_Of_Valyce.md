If you give this to the [Weaver Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink") she
will tell you the following story about [Valyce Of The
Winter](Valyce_Of_The_Winter "wikilink"):

*"Long ago, the lesser Fae, and the High Elves and Drow practiced a form
of ancestor worship. Four of the most powerful Great Fae, including
Valyce, became associated with their seasons of choice. Prayers to
Valyce of the Winter have always fallen on deaf years, for even before
the Dark Fae turned to evil, she was cold and uncaring. The war merely
gave her cruelty as well. There is a reason the Elves and even the Drow
have never settled in cold places. In their early days, the frozen
wastes of the north were Valyce's domain, and she took pains to ensure
they were devoid of life. She has always been feared, and many were they
who secretly smiled to hear she had met her end upon Manon's daggers."*
