If you give this ring to the [Weaver Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink")
she will tell you the following story about
[Yorimandil](Yorimandil_The_Blind "wikilink"):

*After a pause, the Mother Weaver says, "Yorimandil. There has never
been a finer swordsman. He often sparred with the Grand Duke, and with
his main rival, Tessrah the Bladedancer. As the hearts of Dark Fae gave
way to bitterness, Yorimandil remained aloof; He was simply the best,
and that was all that mattered.*

*His inability to beat Yorimandil wore on Malafont, and one day while
sparring, he blinded him in both eyes. Even after this, the Duke still
could not beat him. But Tessrah could, and that was enough. Yorimandil's
heart grew dark, and anger overwhelmed him. He challenged her to a duel,
only to ambush her with the help of the Grand Duke.*

*Against them both, she never stood a chance."*
