If you give this to the [Weaver Mother](Weaver_Mother "wikilink") she
will tell you the following story about [Zydarielle, Queen Of
Stars](Zydarielle,_Queen_Of_Stars "wikilink"):

*"The Dark Queen. What is there to say that has not been said? None in
history can claim to be the seed of so much death, save only the God of
Terror himself. Her return from Oblivion is a tragedy of the universe.
Let us hope it may be corrected before darker events unfold."*
