*Vaguely reminiscent of an ant, apart from it being 7' tall. It is
slightly different to any other cho-ja you have seen. This cho-ja
artisan seems graceful and agile as it calmly spins silk. The abdomen
has four three-jointed legs and is surmounted by a smaller upper thorax,
roughly comparable to a man's torso, with two almost human arms. His
flesh is encased in shiny black chitin. The face is oval, with
multifaceted eyes like metal, above two slits where a nose should be.
The cho-ja's jaw and mouth are surprisingly human in appearance. It
seems to have a placid demeanor, to the extent of ignoring you whilst it
continues spinning.*
