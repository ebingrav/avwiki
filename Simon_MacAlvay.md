*Standing before you is Chalmus' only pupil: Simon MacAlvay. He appears
to you as a lanky blonde human male. While on the outside he presents a
cool and calm demeanor, you can tell that on the inside he is seething
with rage. As if he has been waiting for someone to arrive for quite
awhile, he wastes no time in addressing you.*

*Simon MacAlvay says 'Well met adventurer. I appreciate you coming to my
aid. If you bring me the source of that fool Chalmus' maddening power
I'll give you your due.**
