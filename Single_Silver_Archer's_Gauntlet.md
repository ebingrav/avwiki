Portal to leper. Go north, east, north, up, and search around. Typically
the cultist members will be behind closed doors. Be sure to watch out
for [Cyskadella](Cyskadella "wikilink"); she has been know to take the
life of many unwary travelers.

There are 8 cultists here meaning its easy to farm a good quantity of
these if your hero is big enough. Heroes that are smaller could farm the
[Gauntlets Of Protection](Gauntlets_Of_Protection "wikilink") (same AC,
lower base) instead as its easier to obtain.

Aggressive mobs are in the area.
