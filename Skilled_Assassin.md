*Flipping the dagger from his left to right hand and back, this man
waits patiently for his moment to strike. Clothed in all black, he hides
in magically-made shadows, as there aren't many in these corridors for
him to hide in. He is an assassin out of place, torn here by Veyah's
command, but he tries to adjust as best he can. The man misses the
twists and turns of the Midgaard alleys and hopes to see them and his
allies again soon.*
