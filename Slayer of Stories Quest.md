Visit the Brothers Grimm and they will send you on a quest to confirm
their stories. Pretty self-explanatory what to do, and they give you
clues as to which stories to confirm.

Once you confirm all the stories, go back to visit the Brothers. They
will give you a **Slayer of Stories** cosmetic insignia, together with
1500 exp.
