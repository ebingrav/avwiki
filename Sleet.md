*All [Stormlord](:Category:_Stormlords.md "wikilink")
[spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") manipulate weather in a very
localized manner. They can call forth a blizzard in the middle of a
summer meadow, or a shower of rain while miles underground. They must be
sustained, and will end early if the caster is struck, moved, or enters
a command. Sleet lays down a slick coating of icy sludge, making any
knockdown attempts more likely to be successful. This
[spell](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink") affects ally and foe alike, and
sometimes lingers briefly after the
[Stormlord](:Category:_Stormlords.md "wikilink") stops controlling it.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'sleet'.
