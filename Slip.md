*Look at that crowd fighting over there! What a perfect moment to use
the ultimate of stealth and slip up onto one of those distracted
creatures!*

*Slip enables you to enter another room and attempt to sneak up on a
target instead of joining in the general fighting. If the sneaking up is
succesful, this gives the chance to launch an attack that would
otherwise be limited to the start of a fight, like
[assassinate](Assassinate.md "wikilink") or
[blackjack](Blackjack.md "wikilink"). For other skills, like [vital
shot](Vital_Shot.md "wikilink"), employing them in this fashion will
increase the chances of success, and the damage done.*

*If you hesitate for too long after successfully slipping up on your
target, you waste your chance to attack.*

*The skill relies heavily on your ability to
[sneak](Sneak.md "wikilink") and the
[alertness](Alertness.md "wikilink") of the things going on around you.
A high number of allies fighting improves your chances of sneaking up
successfully, while a high number of opponents increases the chances of
being detected.*

*A group leader using the [Mastermind](Mastermind "wikilink") skill will
noticably increase the odds of succesfully slipping up. Additionally, if
a slip-up [blackjack](Blackjack.md "wikilink") attempt was succesful, a
[Mastermind](Mastermind "wikilink") leader will cause the group to stop
fighting the target.*

Prerequisite(s): [Sneak Attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink"),
[Alertness](Alertness "wikilink").
