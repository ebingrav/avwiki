''Huge and imposing, Slithk the devourer slithers and swims through its
lair. Its huge muscles ripple and flex as it glides with ease. It looks
as if it would be imposing on land, but in the water Slithk is
absolutely terrifying! Slithk the devourer is covered with wounds.

## Comments

There are two water elementals (Level 75 and 77) in the room with
Slithk, who will assist Slithk. The elementals cast a variety of mage
spells and Slithk, armed with a variety of breath attacks, will hit you
with blast of lightning, flame, acid etc. Slithk is part of the [Ancient
Ring Quest](Ancient_Ring_Quest "wikilink").

Contrary to his name, he does not devour corpses. <b>ON REBOOT IT IS
LIKELY THAT HE WILL DEVOUR CORPSES.</b>

It can be a clever idea to try to speedwalk past Slithk to the room
south of The devourer's lair, into the A secret chamber. This room is
not cursed, and one of the groupies can therefore set their recall there
in case a full group CR is needed.
