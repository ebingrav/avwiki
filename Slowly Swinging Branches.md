*If this was a savannah and not such a spot of bitter coldness, and if
that was a lion or leopard and not a tree, one could think the slow

burst into a long run to attack. As it is, one is left with the un-
comfortable feeling of being stalked by the most unlikely of attackers,
a bunch of slowly swinging branches.*
