*You have never before seen a purple turtle, and, indeed, may have
thought it rather an odd color for a turtle to be. But the light
reflecting off this beautifully lustrous shell of deep purple catches
your eye in a most pleasing manner, and you realize that purple really
does look good on a turtle. Especially in contrast to [the bright pink
potion](Pink_Potion "wikilink") clutched in her mouth. You wonder
briefly where she found it. Or why she'd even be carrying such an
impractical item around. Perhaps you should take it from her.*
