*You have never before seen a purple turtle, and, indeed, may have
thought it rather an odd color for a turtle to be. But the light
reflecting off this beautifully lustrous shell of deep purple catches
your eye in a most pleasing manner, and you realize that purple really
does look good on a turtle. Especially in contrast to [the bright pink
potion](Pink_Potion.md "wikilink") clutched in her mouth. You wonder
briefly where she found it. Or why she'd even be carrying such an
impractical item around. Perhaps you should take it from her.*
