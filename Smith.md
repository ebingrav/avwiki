*Smith is the command to instruct a [smith
shopkeeper](:Category:_Smiths.md "wikilink") to
[repair](Repair.md "wikilink") a damaged
[item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") for you. To find out the cost
required to fix your item, use [APPRAISE](Appraise.md "wikilink"). Like
[shops](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink"), you can
[haggle](Haggle.md "wikilink") the price as well as have different costs
for different [Smiths](:Category:_Smiths.md "wikilink"). If you don't
have enough [gold](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink"), the
[Smith](:Category:_Smiths.md "wikilink") will
[repair](Repair.md "wikilink") your
[item](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") with whatever amount of
[gold](Gold_In_Hand.md "wikilink") you DO have to a certain extent.*

Syntax: smith \<[object](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink")\>.
