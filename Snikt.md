Snikt, Implementor, "Prolly as high as you can get". Tyrant/Owner.

"Having played Sloth and ROMII, I came to Farside when they disappeared.
A little after a year and several mudsite moves later, Avatar was
created to provide a high quality and relatively safe gaming experience
with no fees, although donations to cover equipment and operating costs
are always welcome (see help contribution)! :)"

See him for: Critical, mud-wide issues only. Don't 'tell' him unless he
talks first. He can be reached at snikt@outland.org

Responsible for: Primarily design, but he's been known to code,
administer the system, handle operations among other things. His first
opportunity as an Immortal was used to run Quests for other players and
he was later praised for his quick ability to jail, deny, ban and
otherwise whack players or Immortals who were out of control.
