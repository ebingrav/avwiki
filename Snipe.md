*Sniping is a combination of the [longshot](Longshot.md "wikilink") and
[vital shot](Vital_Shot.md "wikilink") abilities that only
[assassins](:Category:_Assassins.md "wikilink") can master. Sniping is
hard, but can deliver considerable damage to enemies, as well as cripple
them from a safe distance. Note that specifying a region to hit is
optional. If none is specified, assume the
[assassin](:Category:_Assassins.md "wikilink") will aim for the vital
area at which he has the clearest shot. This is somewhat easier than
choosing to aim for a specific area.*

Prerequisite(s): none.
