## Comments

As far as known these mobs cannot be reached. But they can reach you.
These mobs will long shot (sniper) you in many rooms of this area. Only
thing known about them is they are 13 of them and not all of them have
all the gear (from the locate spell). All have bow and bracer but only
two have the gloves/cuffs. They must have heightened senses due to
hitting even move/sneak/invis.
