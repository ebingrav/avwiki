A sorcerer needs your help in finding something he lost.

**Start Location:** [Solace](:Category:Town_Of_Solace.md "wikilink")  
**Starting Room:** North End of Bar, in Inn of the Last Home. Look for a
sorcerer, and read his description.  
**Reward:** The sorcerer casts [Protection
Good](Protection_Good "wikilink") on you. However, if you are of good
alignment, this spell will not work on you, and there is no reward.  

**Directions:**

Look for the [scavenger](Scavenger.md "wikilink") in [Highways/Great
Wall](:Category:Highways/Great_Wall.md "wikilink"), and kill him to get
the [Mysterious Old Scroll](Mysterious_Old_Scroll "wikilink"). Give the
scroll to the sorcerer.
