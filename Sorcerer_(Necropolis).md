*Eyes closed, this man appears to be saying prayers under his breath,
though no sound comes from his lips, so perhaps he is ordering someone's

to keep him balanced while he thinks... about whatever it is that he is
pondering. Everyone thought he was just another guard, so they let him
go wherever he wished and do whatever he pleased.*
