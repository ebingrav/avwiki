*While [Molin](Molin_The_Brewer.md "wikilink") left [Mt
Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr.md "wikilink") to seek his fortune, his cousin
Sorin was already hard at work on his plan to become the master brewer
of the Great Dwarven brewery. His plan was not an overnight success, as
he found himself apprenticed to old Tun, the previous masterbrewer, for
over 200 years! Sorin has been in charge of brewing for 100 years now
and has a reputation for inventive and experimental ales, not all of
which are resounding successes. The braver patrons at
[Bomli](Bomli.md "wikilink")'s are always willing to try his latest ale,
but with names like 'The Goatherder', 'Rat Droppings', 'Waggle Dancer'
and 'How Peculiar!', you are never quite sure what you are going to
get.*
