''SPEAK is used to either identify the
[languages](:Category:_Languages "wikilink") you currently know (type
SPEAK), or to change from one [tongue](:Category:_Languages "wikilink")
to another (type SPEAK [COMMON](Common_Language "wikilink") for
example). Only those with that
[Language](:Category:_Languages "wikilink") ability or [an
Immortal](:Category:_Immortals "wikilink") can understand you, others
will only hear/see garbage if said (The only exception to this is
[COMMON](Common_Language "wikilink"), which all players can understand).

Syntax: speak \<[language](:Category:_Languages "wikilink")\>.

This [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") only affects
communication via [*in-character*
channels](:Category:_In-Character_Channels "wikilink"); any
communication via [*out-of-character*
channels](:Category:_Out-of-Character_Channels "wikilink") will remain
entirely unaffected by it.
