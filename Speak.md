''SPEAK is used to either identify the
[languages](:Category:_Languages.md "wikilink") you currently know (type
SPEAK), or to change from one
[tongue](:Category:_Languages.md "wikilink") to another (type SPEAK
[COMMON](Common_Language.md "wikilink") for example). Only those with
that [Language](:Category:_Languages.md "wikilink") ability or [an
Immortal](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink") can understand you, others
will only hear/see garbage if said (The only exception to this is
[COMMON](Common_Language.md "wikilink"), which all players can
understand).

Syntax: speak \<[language](:Category:_Languages.md "wikilink")\>.

This [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") only affects
communication via [*in-character*
channels](:Category:_In-Character_Channels.md "wikilink"); any
communication via [*out-of-character*
channels](:Category:_Out-of-Character_Channels.md "wikilink") will
remain entirely unaffected by it.
