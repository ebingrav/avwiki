Rippers have access to a group of skills which enhance their racial
abilities. Practicing the Ripper skill Specimen allows you to select one
racial enhancement skill using the enhance command.

Some races will have access to multiple Racial Enhancement skills. Some
will have only one, and some will have none at all. Once this choice has
been made, it cannot be undone.
