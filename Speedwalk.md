Speedwalking is a method where players "stack" commands to quickly
bypass a dangerous mob, a water-filled room where they might drown, or
other hazards.

Players can accomplish this by one of three methods: using their
particular client software, by the use of the in-game activator
character, or by creating a temporary alias.

To use the client software, reference that particular program's
helpfiles. As an example,
[CMud](http://forums.zuggsoft.com/index.php?p=cmud) uses the ";"
character as a default activator, although this can be changed by user
preference.

In game, the "=" equals sign is the default activator character. To
quickly move three rooms west, open a north door and move one room
north, the command would be:

*w=w=w=open n=n*

Any valid AVATAR command can be stacked in this manner with equals signs
in between commands.

To create a temporary [alias](alias "wikilink"), the player would type
the following in preparation:

*alias temp w:w:w:open n:n*

To activate the alias when ready, the player types: *temp*

The mud would then receive the commands *w w w open n n* in quick
succession.

Ideally, any of these methods should get you past the danger area,
however there is a chance an aggressive mob may get a quick hit in,
which will cancel out the rest of the commands and leave you stuck in
the middle of a fight.
