*From the plane of energy, a clever mage can find condensed deposits*of
light. If the mage can then remove it to the plane of stone using *a
certain incantation, the energy will form a perfect sphere the size*of a
melon. It's color is a white pearl but when held, it glows with ''a
bright everlasting light.
