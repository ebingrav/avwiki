*Immediately aware of your presence near him, Manuel smiles gently.*

*"Perhaps you are wondering why my life force remains here, even though
my physical body has long since decayed and been absorbed into this
glacier. Perhaps I should explain."*

*"I am a Nephilim, or 'High Man', a race that has not ever existed on
this plane of existence. I came here because I wished to teach the
younger races the merits of civilization," Pausing a moment to let this
information sink in, he continues. "Things did not go exactly as
planned."*

*"When I fought Tourach, he and I both managed to severely wound each
other. When we fell into this glacier, the impact was too much for my
physical body to handle. Nephilim, however, have the ability to seperate
their life force from their bodies, if there is still a need for that
entity. Demons do something similar, hiding their life force to make
themselves quasi-invulnerable and nigh immortal. But that's not really
information you need at the moment."*

*"While I was performing such actions as I needed to on this realm
before passing on, my sword disappeared. This is mildly troubling, as I
do not wish it to fall into the wrong hands. I believe, however, that a
comrade of mine, a powerful wizard who was my assistant, named... no,
that would not help, as wizards rarely keep a name, nor do I feel he
would appreciate me telling you his true name."*

*Smiling sadly, Saint Manuel continues, "He is one of the last surviving
followers of my teachings. He will, as such, be a peaceful wizard,
striving to teach people through an illusory challenge, concerning most
likely emotions or a state of mind. I have a symbol that he will
understand. I ask that you defeat me here, so that I may continue my
journey. If you do so, take the symbol, and give it to this wizard. My
sword will then be yours."*
