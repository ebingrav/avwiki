Syntax: cast spiritlink <item>  
Prerequisites:
[consecrate](http://avatar.melanarchy.info/index.php?=Consecrate)

When prayed upon, a bond can be formed with an object while maintaining
direct contact. With this spiritlink, any damage that would have been
done to the object will instead be transferred to the person. (There is
a chance of failure in making this bond and it is more severe against
destructive spells.)

`     'With a prayer, the cleric did care for the sacred Chalice of`  
`      Goliott.  Tul-Sith be merciful.  Tul-Sith be praised.'`  
`                            - Book of Tul-Sith, Chapter 2, Verse 12`

Keep in mind, once you stow an item in a container or drop it, the bond
is immediately broken.
