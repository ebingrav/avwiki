This is a hero quest, lords need not apply. The quest holds MANY
variables but so far the results have shown to be consistent - there are
no random results for a given action.

1.  Go to the [Faceless Statue](Faceless_Statue "wikilink") in [River
    Etuan](:Category:River_Etuan.md "wikilink"). It is located east of
    [Asimov](Asimov "wikilink") and is accessible during the day, and
    with proper detects.
2.  Once next to it, wake it up by addressing it with a keyword
    appropriately inscribed on its forehead. Communication with it is
    [rather straightforward](Tell.md "wikilink").
3.  You get to hunt relics! There appears to be a single relic per area,
    usually on bosses. So far 8 have been found. You will only get to
    imbue 3.
4.  Once you have 3 desired relics, return to it, wake it up and follow
    the instructions. At any point tell it to cancel to get the item
    into an unwearable (but identifiable) state, if you exit the chamber
    (through the pillar).
5.  Giving 3rd relic will finalize the item. You're done. Gain [Spirits
    Of Eragora Insignia](Spirits_Of_Eragora_Insignia "wikilink").
6.  Relics won't appear on mobs unless someone who has started the quest
    is in the group.

What IS the item? Always a gauntlet (hands slot), at lvl54, with
major-ward, bless, dark, glow and magic flags. So far four have been
found and they correspond to the player's class.

    unable to give monocle and shawl to get 4 archery mods.
