*A sponge in common Avatarian usage is a character who gains experience
points in a group while contributing the absolute minimum to a group.
This most often happens when a character follows the tank, but makes no
additional attacks other than the basic melee attacks of their class.
Typically silent during a run, a sponging character may go afk without
warning, may be slow when following instructions from the group leader
and will generally be inattentive to the goings on.*

*This is not to say that a sponge cannot be an effective group member,
particularly if they are well equipped, but merely that they could be
more effective if they were paying attention!*

*To many, labelling a character as a sponge is a form of insult and a
player who has a reputation for sponging may find getting groups
harder.*
