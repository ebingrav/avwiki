## Directions

Loads on the floor at the mob [the Eater of
Reality](Eater_Of_Reality "wikilink"), in the room **A gaping hole in a
tortured reality**.

From [stone trickster](Stone_Trickster "wikilink"): e2s, pull bloom,
2sesesesu. You are now in the room with the invisible agressive, high
level psi-mob [the eye of the storm](Eye_Of_The_Storm "wikilink"). The
exits in this room changes every repop, and from there you want to go in
the direction where you see a scan description of **A circular hole
sucks at the substance of this tattered reality.** These two
[devourers](Devourer "wikilink") wander between two rooms, so maybe you
will not see them till they move. When you enter the room named **Up in
a splintered tree**, go up and south to get to [the Eater of
Reality](Eater_Of_Reality "wikilink").
