## Directions

Loads on the floor at the mob [the Eater of
Reality](Eater_Of_Reality.md "wikilink"), in the room **A gaping hole in
a tortured reality**.

From [stone trickster](Stone_Trickster.md "wikilink"): e2s, pull bloom,
2sesesesu. You are now in the room with the invisible agressive, high
level psi-mob [the eye of the storm](Eye_Of_The_Storm.md "wikilink").
The exits in this room changes every repop, and from there you want to
go in the direction where you see a scan description of **A circular
hole sucks at the substance of this tattered reality.** These two
[devourers](Devourer.md "wikilink") wander between two rooms, so maybe
you will not see them till they move. When you enter the room named **Up
in a splintered tree**, go up and south to get to [the Eater of
Reality](Eater_Of_Reality.md "wikilink").
