*A [sprite](Sprites "wikilink")
[priestess](:Category:_Priests "wikilink") beams warmly at you. "I had
such a great distance to travel when [Baron
Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre "wikilink") summoned me here to help
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink") destroy the evil darklin, and,
with so many of them prowling about
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink") these days, I nearly didn't
survive my journey! Apparently, our fellow [sprites](Sprites "wikilink")
of the [Oak Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink") have been
monitoring the growing darklin problem here and realized that, if these
darklin kept spreading, then the [Oak
Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink") might soon be under siege, as
well. Since none of them felt competent enough to go engage the darklin
on their own, they appealed for help from [Baron
Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre "wikilink"), who sent me and two other
[sprites](Sprites "wikilink") here to fight on their behalf. If I
survive this conflict, then I think that I may retire to the [Oak
Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink")--perhaps they'll even give me
a heroine's welcome! It seems like a lovely place to me, as does
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink"), except where I've noticed
darklin damage beginning to show. Once it becomes safe to do so again,
perhaps we [sprites](Sprites "wikilink") can begin working to reverse
that damage and thus restore [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")
to its pristine state. Ah, well, enough dreaming of our future for
now--I must return to focusing on our present. Take care, my new friend,
and may [Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith "wikilink") bless you and protect you in our
worthy cause."*
