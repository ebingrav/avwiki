*A [sprite](Sprites "wikilink")
[fusilier](:Category:_Fusiliers "wikilink") beams warmly at you.
"Fascinating," she exclaims, "have you examined these marks? No
[sprite](Sprites "wikilink") has laid eyes upon these glyphs in ages!
I'm sure that [the Baron](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre "wikilink") will be
intrigued to learn all about them. But I digress; let me introduce
myself..." This [sprite](Sprites "wikilink") then proudly identifies
herself as one of three [sprites](Sprites "wikilink") sent here by
[Baron Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre "wikilink") to help
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink") in exterminating
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s darklin infestation. When
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger "wikilink") had appealed to the [Oak
Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle "wikilink")'s
[sprites](Sprites "wikilink") for aid, explaining to them how
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood "wikilink")'s darklin were spreading and
would eventually threaten their home too, they had appealed reluctantly
in turn to [Baron Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre "wikilink"), who was
all too happy to respond, as he hoped that it would help to "legitimize"
his claims of authority over them. "I don't want to bore you with
[sprite](Sprites "wikilink") politics, though," she adds, "and, besides,
we all have much more important things to concern ourselves with now,
like preparing ourselves to attack the darklin. May
[Roixa](Roixa "wikilink") be with you, my new friend."*
