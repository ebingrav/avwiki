*A [sprite](Sprites.md "wikilink")
[priestess](:Category:_Priests.md "wikilink") beams warmly at you. "I
had such a great distance to travel when [Baron
Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre.md "wikilink") summoned me here to help
[Silvanus](Centaur_Ranger.md "wikilink") destroy the evil darklin, and,
with so many of them prowling about
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") these days, I nearly
didn't survive my journey! Apparently, our fellow
[sprites](Sprites.md "wikilink") of the [Oak
Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle.md "wikilink") have been monitoring the
growing darklin problem here and realized that, if these darklin kept
spreading, then the [Oak Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle.md "wikilink")
might soon be under siege, as well. Since none of them felt competent
enough to go engage the darklin on their own, they appealed for help
from [Baron Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre.md "wikilink"), who sent me
and two other [sprites](Sprites.md "wikilink") here to fight on their
behalf. If I survive this conflict, then I think that I may retire to
the [Oak Circle](:Category:_Oak_Circle.md "wikilink")--perhaps they'll
even give me a heroine's welcome! It seems like a lovely place to me, as
does [Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink"), except where I've
noticed darklin damage beginning to show. Once it becomes safe to do so
again, perhaps we [sprites](Sprites.md "wikilink") can begin working to
reverse that damage and thus restore
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink") to its pristine state. Ah,
well, enough dreaming of our future for now--I must return to focusing
on our present. Take care, my new friend, and may
[Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith.md "wikilink") bless you and protect you in our
worthy cause."*
