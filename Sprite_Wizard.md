*A [sprite](Sprites.md "wikilink")
[wizard](:Category:_Wizards.md "wikilink") notices your gaze and smiles
sheepishly. "I'm sorry but I just can't help myself sometimes--it's so
much fun! And, with all of this drilling that we've been doing lately, I
could surely use a little rest and relaxation. Actually, it looks like
most of us here are taking a break right now. It won't be much longer
now before we mount our first attack on the [darklin
nest](:Category:_Darklin_Hole.md "wikilink") that we believe is located
just a bit northwest of here--and then, if we succeed there, we'll
proceed to their other strongholds around
[Westwood](:Category:_Westwood.md "wikilink"). And I think that we WILL
succeed. Whatever these [centaurs](Centaurs.md "wikilink") and others
here may lack in their skill is more than compensated for by their
dedication, it seems to me. So many have fled their homes or lost some
of their loved ones to these hideous darklin. I hope to never see such
tragedy again! Nevertheless, I'm ready to go and fight wherever [Baron
Sarphyre](Baron_Amier_Sarphyre.md "wikilink") may send me. Ooo,
look--there's another one!" And so, off he flits after yet another
butterfly.*
