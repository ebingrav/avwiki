From 'help Ssithtarrs Fur Collection':

*Within a shallow cave in Cryptid Hollow, there is a serpentine figure
who finds himself in a most perplexing perdicament: satisfying Queen
Hcuyj of Igecsoz before she has his head.*

*Perhaps you can aid him in his efforts before it is too late, and his
blood is spilled?*

**NOTE:** *This quest is written for players who are levels 20-25, and
must be completed by level 25.*

Completetion of this quest will include the [Ssithtarr's Fur Collection
Insignia](Ssithtarr's_Fur_Collection_Insignia "wikilink") along with the
main prize, the [Ringmail Tasset](Ringmail_Tasset "wikilink").

Here's a hint. There are three mobs to kill to complete this quest. The
first is on the first level, the second is on the second level and the
third is all the way at the bottom. Happy Hunting!

Here are three that work:

1.  hairy hominid (wad of fur)
2.  curious carcass (hairy limb stalk -- but it's nodrop?!)
3.  Chuchunaa (jambs of matted fur)
