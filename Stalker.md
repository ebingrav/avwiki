*This shapeless, continually changing killer is guarding [Lord
Redtooth](Lord_Redtooth "wikilink")'s inner chamber. You watch in horror
as many of your blows pass harmlessly through what had been the
creature's body just seconds before. Summoned from some distant plane by
[Slithk](Slithk "wikilink"), the creature seems at least in some way
connected to the evil that has overtaken the island.*
