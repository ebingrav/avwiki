*This [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") is used to activate
stance [skills](:Category:_Skills "wikilink"). All stance
[skills](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") have several things in common:
You can only use one Stance at a time; activating a new one cancels the
one you are presently using; stance
[skills](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") are ended if the player changes
position, such as by [sleeping](Sleep_(command) "wikilink"),
[resting](Rest "wikilink"), failing a [bash](Bash "wikilink"), being
[tripped](Trip "wikilink"), etc.; stances are exhausted when they end,
regardless of how they end. Some examples of stances include [Tiger
Stance](Tiger_Stance "wikilink") and [Bear
Stance](Bear_Stance "wikilink").*

Syntax: stance <stance name>.

Stances were brought back in mid-2006, after being gone for a long, long
time.
