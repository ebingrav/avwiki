*This [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") is used to activate
stance [skills](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink"). All stance
[skills](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") have several things in common:
You can only use one Stance at a time; activating a new one cancels the
one you are presently using; stance
[skills](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") are ended if the player
changes position, such as by [sleeping](Sleep_(command).md "wikilink"),
[resting](Rest.md "wikilink"), failing a [bash](Bash.md "wikilink"),
being [tripped](Trip.md "wikilink"), etc.; stances are exhausted when
they end, regardless of how they end. Some examples of stances include
[Tiger Stance](Tiger_Stance.md "wikilink") and [Bear
Stance](Bear_Stance.md "wikilink").*

Syntax: stance <stance name>.

Stances were brought back in mid-2006, after being gone for a long, long
time.
