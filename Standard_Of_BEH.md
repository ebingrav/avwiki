## Comments

The manifest holder is an item with a keyword **banner**, that also
needs to have armor class, thus technically fall into the category of
[Armor](:Category:Armor.md "wikilink"). Do not use one from
[Deepways](:Category:Deepways.md "wikilink") (treasure) not one on the
guards in [Midgaard](:Category:Midgaard.md "wikilink") (light). An
appropriate banner can be found on Eragora in the area of [Sphynx
Gate](:Category:Sphynx_Gate.md "wikilink").

The banner can be found by going to the room that is south, then east
til first north, go all north, enter cave from the ferry drop off (the
northern most room on the map). There is a hidden entrance in the room
with the keyword of "cave". The banner repops on the ground in the cave.
There is only one exit, back to the room you came in from - note the
banner will not repop unless nobody is in the area as it spawns on the
ground.

By comparison, [LeMans Family Seal](LeMans_Family_Seal "wikilink") is
-10, so this item would be LeMans -12, with the added hp bonus, and
possibility of even more AC since the base for hero manifest items goes
up to 14.

**Warning**: "The Standard of \[BEH\]" is the item name, not the
**manifest** name used with c manifest "item".

<spoiler text="click here for spoilers"> The recipe is 1 diamond, 1
amethyst, 2 ruby, 1 emerald. The manifest name is Beh's Standard.  
c manifest banner "beh's standard" </spoiler>

Recipe can be found on the continent of
[Eragora](:Category:Eragora.md "wikilink"). Process of locating it's
parts is a rather difficult exercise - 5 pieces are scattered across 5
of the Eragoran areas. For those interested, they tell a story of the
Eragoran early pioneers.
