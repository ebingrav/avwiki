*This statue to the god after which this city was named is perhaps the
finest work of any you have seen here yet. The realism of the paint work
and the addition of real clothing make it look as if it's actually
breathing.*

## Comments

Big, mean mob that hits like a freight train and has the distinction of
being the largest portable aggressive mob on Midgaard. Many a newbie
(and often hero) group has been completely destroyed when they
accidentally wander into this mob. This mob is good for about 290 xp
solo. The statue is very aggressive! Hence the old nasty joke of "portal
st ig" when asking for dirs to whatever gear.
