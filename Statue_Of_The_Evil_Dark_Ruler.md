*Evil glowing eyes peer from the skull of the statue. They seem alive
with real demonic power. It is the statue of Kariya, the evil dark ruler
of Utami. Clad in his usual black armor, holding his fiendish dark
blade, and with a sardonic smile on his lips the statue seems to look
down at you.*

This mob doesn't aggie and is in the same room as the altar entrance to
Neraka. He does cast several mage spells though.
