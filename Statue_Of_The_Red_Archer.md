*Dressed in red clothes, a large bone bow in his hand, and an evil grin
on his face. That is how people shall always remember Rackhir, the evil
red archer priest. It has been long since he has last visited these
realms, but his legacy remains. His face is slightly turned towards one
of the other statues, that of his love May.*

## Comments

This mob, like other archer mobs, will generally strike you once every
round for a largish amount of damage. Fortunately, you can kill him with
2x s4 disintegrates.
