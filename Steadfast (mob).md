*Steadfast is a once powerful [dwarf](Dwarves "wikilink") approaching
his twilight years, much of his muscle now run to fat. He has all of the
attributes of a successful guard, namely an ability to find a bright
side in almost any situation, an appreciation of strong ale and as long
as he is fed regularly he doesn't mind long hours. In fact he's pretty
hungry right now...*
