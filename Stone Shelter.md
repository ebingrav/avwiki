This used to be the most commonly used room for Planar Anchor until
racial changes added tail to some water mobs. It is the lloydable room
in water proper. It is located nneu from shift. This is a much safer
shifting point most of the time, as it's the only single-exit room in
water proper (aside from the Ruler section) and does not have a sentinel
mob in it as shift commonly does.
