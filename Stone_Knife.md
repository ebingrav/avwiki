*This knife was probably fashioned as some sort of personal talisman: In
long work a piece of dark stone has been split up along its edges, until
they were as sharp as a steel blade. Yet the jaggedness of the material
makes its cuts particularly nasty. This piece is fastened in a haft made
from the hacked of foot of a large wolf.*
