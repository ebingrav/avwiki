**WARNING:** There are aggies all over this area, every direction that
follows will have aggies along the way. You will need fly and pass-door
at times.

-   Portal to [Shen](Shen "wikilink") or go 16e, \[e\], 2e, n, 2e, 3s,
    3e, 3n, 2w, 3n, w, n, e, n, e, 3n, 2e, 2s, 3e, 2s, 2e, 3s, 3e, n,
    2e, n, e, 2n, e, 2s from [Aelmon](Aelmon "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   From Shen, go d, 3n, w, 2n, 2e, 7n, {d} to get to the [Ice
    Nagas](Ice_Naga.md "wikilink") (Ice nagas are also portable, but
    aggie).

<!-- -->

-   Kill Nagas until you get the [ice
    seed](Ice_Seed_(Ice_Naga).md "wikilink"). There are a bunch of
    nagas, but only one of them carries the seed.

<!-- -->

-   After you get the seed, find the room called 'The frigid lake' and
    then go {u}, 6w, 2s to get to [Grandmother
    Ent](Grandmother_Ent "wikilink")

<!-- -->

-   Give the [ice seed](Ice_Seed_(Ice_Naga).md "wikilink") you got from
    the Ice Naga to Grandmother Ent and she'll prepare it for
    [Greigon](Greigon "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   From Grandmother Ent, go 2n, 5e, 2n, w, 8n, w, d, w, n and then
    speedwalk w, get seed, e. If you don't speedwalk,
    [Kroska](Kroska "wikilink") will aggie you.

<!-- -->

-   From the room next to Kroska, go s, e, u, e, n, 3u, 2n, w, u, n to
    get to [Greigon](Greigon "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   Give the seeds to Greigon to get [Storm
    Brew](Storm_Brew "wikilink").

This is technically 2 separate quests. You can give the seed from next
to Kroska to Greigon without messing with the ice naga or grandmother
ent and get a storm brew. Or you can do the Grandmother Ent part without
getting Kroska's seed. The above directions will complete both quests.
