''Note: This item has been grandfathered along with the
[Circus](:Category:_Circus.md "wikilink"). It has been replaced by the
[Bear Skin Bracelet](Bear_Skin_Bracelet "wikilink") found in the
[Carnival](:Category:_Carnival.md "wikilink"). The following information
has been left for historical purposes.

**Note: to complete this mini-quest you will need some means of
detecting hidden. Get the [Pink Potion](Pink_Potion "wikilink") from
[Mudschool](:Category:_Avatar_Mudschool.md "wikilink") or the [Cup Of
Gremlin Blood](Cup_Of_Gremlin_Blood "wikilink") from [Grunka's Kombat
Skool](:Category:Grunka's_Kombat_Skool.md "wikilink").**

From the entrance to the Circus go one south and buy a ticket.

Then go 2s, e, s, and kill [Ivan](Ivan "wikilink"). Note that he hides,
so this is where you need to quaff your detect hidden potion. Once he's
dead make sure to loot the key from his corpse.

Then go n, w, 2s, unlock s, open s, to gain access to the bigtop.

From here go 3s, u, 3w, \[d\], e, n. In this room will be Ivan's chest.
Unlock it, loot it, and claim your prize.

**Be warned:** Do not go down from the centre of the tightrope, as you
will end up in the lion tamer's cage and have your corpse eaten by
lions. Go to the far western end of the tightrope and type "open down".
I know you can't see the down exit, but it is there.
