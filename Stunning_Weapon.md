*With this spell, a psionicist can impart upon her weapons the ability
to inspire dread. This causes a victim to be paralyzed by fear,
rendering them unable to react intelligently.*

Prerequisite(s): [Dancing Weapon](Dancing_Weapon "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](cast "wikilink") 'stunning weapon' (self only)

This spell procs very frequently (at least a third of the time) and
stuns the mob for approximately one round. It is very useful at all
tiers, but especially at lord, as it can significantly reduce a mob's
ability to cast, thereby reducing spell damage taken by the group. It is
a popular choice until [Felling Weapon](Felling_Weapon "wikilink")
becomes available.
