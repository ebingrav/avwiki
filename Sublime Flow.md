*The bladedancer must wield two identical cutting (slicing or slashing)
weapons of low weight and have entered a bladetrance.*

*Once so armed, the bladedancer maneuvers about their foe and places her
swords against them, such that their foe's momentum pulls them along and
against the blades, even as she swiftly draws them in the opposite
direction.*

*To accomplish such efficient attacks, the bladedancer must move in
concert with her foes, creating a sublime ebb and flow of movement, as
she alternately moves first with, and then contrary to, her opponents.*

*Not only will her attacks cause greater harm to her foes, but this
technique also incorporates the methods of the sublime strike, thus
permitting the bladedancer to make vital shot attacks with cutting
weapons.*

*The effects of this technique are enhanced if it is used while under
the effects of a bladetrance. The deeper the trance, the more that the
bladedancer will intuitively understand of her enemies movements, and
the better her use of those movements to assist her attacks.*

*The maximum weight of cutting weapons useable with this skill may be
viewed with the abilities command, once Sublime Flow has been
practiced.*
