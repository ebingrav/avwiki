*The [Bladedancer](:Category:_Bladedancers "wikilink") fighting style
requires two identical [weapons](:Category:_Melee_Weapons "wikilink").
They must be the exact same item, not merely named the same or the same
[weight](Object_Weight "wikilink"). If these conditions are met, the
[Bladedancer](:Category:_Bladedancers "wikilink") with Sublime Grace can
use their offhand [weapon](:Category:_Melee_Weapons "wikilink") just as
effectively as their main one, in terms of the number of hit attempts
they gain per round. Also, because the
[Dancer](:Category:_Bladedancers "wikilink") isn't favoring either
[weapon](:Category:_Melee_Weapons "wikilink"), they become harder to
[disarm](Disarm "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Dual](Dual "wikilink"), [Poise](Poise "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
