*Sublime Strike is a move which may be woven into the Bladedance,
improving its effectiveness.*

*Where a skilled swordsman might be able to exploit the openings in an
attacking opponent's defenses and strike back, a bladedancer can go a
step further, and direct her riposte toward an opponent's vital organs.*

*While performing the Bladedance, this skill gives a chance to
automatically use Vital Shot when dodging attacks instead of a simple
riposte.*

*The effects of this technique are enhanced if it is used while under
the effects of a bladetrance. The deeper the trance, the more likely
that the bladedancer will intuitively find an opening through which she
can strike at a vital spot when dodging, and the more likely that the
vital shot will have a significant effect.*
