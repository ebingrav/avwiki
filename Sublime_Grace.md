*The [Bladedancer](:Category:_Bladedancers.md "wikilink") fighting style
requires two identical
[weapons](:Category:_Melee_Weapons.md "wikilink"). They must be the
exact same item, not merely named the same or the same
[weight](Object_Weight.md "wikilink"). If these conditions are met, the
[Bladedancer](:Category:_Bladedancers.md "wikilink") with Sublime Grace
can use their offhand [weapon](:Category:_Melee_Weapons.md "wikilink")
just as effectively as their main one, in terms of the number of hit
attempts they gain per round. Also, because the
[Dancer](:Category:_Bladedancers.md "wikilink") isn't favoring either
[weapon](:Category:_Melee_Weapons.md "wikilink"), they become harder to
[disarm](Disarm.md "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): [Dual](Dual.md "wikilink"),
[Poise](Poise.md "wikilink").

Syntax: none (automatic).
