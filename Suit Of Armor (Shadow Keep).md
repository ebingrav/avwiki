*Once worn by the Master and his elder son, this suit of armor has seen
better days. Its breastplate is tarnished and dented and its weapons
have lost their edge. A dull red glow comes from the closed visor, but
when you open the helm you find nothing... until it clanks towards you.*

`A suit of armor is using:`  
<wielded>`           a rusted sword`

## Comments

The suit of armor's weapon has a -4/-4 modifier to [hit
roll](Hit_Roll "wikilink") and [damage roll](Damage_Roll "wikilink"), so
it's recommended to not [disarm](Disarm "wikilink"), or
[decept](Deception "wikilink") them. [Bioscan](Bioscan "wikilink")
reveals that this mob is aggressive, but it has never aggressed me
before so I am not labeling it aggressive.
