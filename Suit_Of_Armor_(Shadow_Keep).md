*Once worn by the Master and his elder son, this suit of armor has seen
better days. Its breastplate is tarnished and dented and its weapons
have lost their edge. A dull red glow comes from the closed visor, but
when you open the helm you find nothing... until it clanks towards you.*

## Gear

`A suit of armor is using:`  
<wielded>`           a rusted sword`

## Comments

The suit of armor's weapon has a -4/-4 modifier to [hit
roll](Hit_Roll.md "wikilink") and [damage
roll](Damage_Roll.md "wikilink"), so it's recommended to not
[disarm](Disarm.md "wikilink"), or [decept](Deception.md "wikilink")
them. [Bioscan](Bioscan "wikilink") reveals that this mob is aggressive,
but it has never aggressed me before so I am not labeling it aggressive.
