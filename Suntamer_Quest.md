This quest takes place within [Mountain
Tunnels](:Category:Mountain_Tunnels.md "wikilink"), on
[Eragora](:Category:Eragora.md "wikilink"). A small yet powerful group
is suggested to complete it.

-   Upon arriving on Eragora proper, teleport to [Halfling
    Spy](Halfling_Spy "wikilink"). From here you must reach
    [Throdak](Throdak "wikilink").
    -   Either by complete [Mountain Adventurer
        Quest](Mountain_Adventurer_Quest "wikilink") and enter the area
        through gate proper: 2s, {e}, e, u, n, u, e
    -   Or simply *push vegetation* and e, s, e, u, n, u, e
-   If you arrive while it is in-game day, he will address you. Say
    *yes* to accept the quest.
-   Walk d, 2n, e, \[s\] to enter the altar room, and defeat [Guardian
    Of The Moon](Guardian_Of_The_Moon "wikilink") protecting it.
-   Quaff to be transported into the quest part of the area. You will
    arrive at the north-west corner of a 3x2 block. (See
    [map](Mountain_Tunnels_Map.md "wikilink"))
-   Kill all the [Moon Guards](Moon_Guard "wikilink"), including the
    [Silent Golem](Silent_Golem "wikilink") to proceed. They are all
    rather big and have uncomfortable abilities, from "standard" warrior
    specs to [Death Field](Death_Field "wikilink").
-   Once all are dead a [Frantic Guard](Frantic_Guard "wikilink") will
    appear (along other reinforcements) just north of the door, where
    the golem used to be. Kill him to unlock the door, but beware his
    mnd abilities - he can easily [scramble](Scramble.md "wikilink") and
    [overconfidence](Overconfidence.md "wikilink").
-   Go s, and defeat the demigod [Erashnak](Erashnak "wikilink"). While
    his gear is lackluster, be sure to loot the [Wand Of The
    Moon](Wand_Of_The_Moon "wikilink").
-   Return to [Throdak](Throdak "wikilink") who will ask to be zapped -
    so do it.
-   Throdak will become aggressive and attack - kill him for his gear
    (rather lackluster as well) and his wield - the [Great Axe
    "Suntamer"](Great_Axe_"Suntamer" "wikilink").
