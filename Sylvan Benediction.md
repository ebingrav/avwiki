**Syntax: cast 'sylvan benediction**'

*While druids are the most well known divine casters to follow Roixa,
there are a group of clerics who follow the deity of nature. They have
created a spell which provides protection against earth magic for the
caster's group. It will also aid the tracking ability of the caster.*

*This is a powerful pantheon spell. Any single cleric can only maintain
(i.e. be the caster of) one of these spells at any given time.*
