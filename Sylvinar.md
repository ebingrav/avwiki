''Sylvinar smiles and beckons you close. Though weary, he wishes to tell
you something.

Sylvinar says 'I'm glad to see someone else of noble heart is here on
this island with me. We may not have much time so I will keep this
short.'

The old mage seems to gather his words and thoughts before beginning.

'Lord Audis, the rightful lord of these waters, has been hearing rumors
and bloody tales about particularly nasty pirate activity as of late.'

'Whole families and crews have been taken away never to be seen again
while some ships filled with priceless goods have been left unspoilt. It
seems these pirates deal in human bodies rather than their traditional
gold and silver...'

'No matter how many soldiers Audis commits to the task,' Sylvinar
continues, 'they have been unable to lay hands on the pirates
responsible for these atrocities, nor have they been able to locate any
of the missing civilians.'

Sylvinar sighs heavily.

'So, you see, I was sent to this island, on which the famous pirate
commodore Lord Redtooth is said to reside. I had hoped that at the very
least Redtooth might be able to provide some clues as to the recent
happens.'

An angry scowl coming across his face, Sylvinar tells you, 'Upon coming
to this island I was confronted by a sense of a great evil and impending
doom. It is as if some unholy force pushes these pirates on past the
limits of mere humans. I feel that the cause of the recent kidnappings
may well be in this island somewhere. This abomination must be
confronted!'

'Consult with Lord Redtooth if you can. Bring me any word he can give
you on the recent disappearances. I don't think that I need to remind
you of the importance of this. Finally, destroy the evil behind all of
this and bring me proof of your deeds! I will make sure you are
generously rewarded!' ''
