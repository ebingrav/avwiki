*A T'dvar [rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") notices you looking
at him and seems to be terribly displeased. Apparently, nobody here is
supposed to notice that he walks among them. "I am here only to help,"
he hisses softly, "as we T'dvar have sensed the encroaching darklin and
their threat to our peoples. You need know nothing more about me."
Before silently slinking away, he adds, almost inaudibly, "If you seek
answers about our missing, you may find some within a ferny glen.
[LOOK](Look.md "wikilink") carefully and you may learn much here,
stranger."*
