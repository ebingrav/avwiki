''Syntax: tnl

''Typing TNL will display the TNL of all playable races.

This field, whose name is an acronym for "to next level," indicates how
many [experience points](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") a
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") must yet gain in order
to reach another [level](Level.md "wikilink").

Each time a [character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") gains
[experience points](Experience_Points.md "wikilink"), its TNL will
decrease by this amount.

Each time a [character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink")'s TNL
decreases to zero or below, (1) it will gain one
[level](Level.md "wikilink") and (2) its TNL will increase by its
"[racial TNL](Racial_TNL.md "wikilink")," which is determined by its
[race](:Category:_Races.md "wikilink").

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") may view their TNL
using their [score](Score.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink").

See also [Experience Points](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") and
[Racial TNL](Racial_TNL.md "wikilink").
