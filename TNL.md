''Syntax: tnl

''Typing TNL will display the TNL of all playable races.

This field, whose name is an acronym for "to next level," indicates how
many [experience points](Experience_Points "wikilink") a
[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") must yet gain in order to
reach another [level](Level "wikilink").

Each time a [character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") gains
[experience points](Experience_Points "wikilink"), its TNL will decrease
by this amount.

Each time a [character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink")'s TNL
decreases to zero or below, (1) it will gain one
[level](Level "wikilink") and (2) its TNL will increase by its "[racial
TNL](Racial_TNL "wikilink")," which is determined by its
[race](:Category:_Races "wikilink").

[Characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink") may view their TNL using
their [score](Score "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink").

See also [Experience Points](Experience_Points "wikilink") and [Racial
TNL](Racial_TNL "wikilink").
