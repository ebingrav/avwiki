*With agreements written with blood ages past, sorcerers have learned of
an ability to increase their learning through a bitter spell. With this
tainted genius, your experience is increased. Beware the side-effects,
however. Once your brilliance disappears, a taint remains, causing large
penalties upon death.*

*This spell is EXHAUSTED for a long time when cast.*

Prerequisite(s): [Corruption](Corruption.md "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast.md "wikilink") 'tainted genius' \[Self Only Spell\]

This spell doubles your experience gained for a short amount of time.
After that wears off you are subject to a variety of nasty status
effects. An example would be dying with this spell while worshipping
quixoltan as a Dragon. You'll lose 25-35000xp instantly.
