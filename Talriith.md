*This member of the Riithi surveyor caste is applying his experience and
knowledge in an attempt to find some hidden chamber which might hold
some great High Drow treasure. This talriith is smaller than the
[yuriithi](Yuriith.md "wikilink") working in the other parts of the
cavern, yet he is much more [intelligent](Intelligence.md "wikilink"),
being well suited to a life of solitary scouting and mapping. His overly
large ears help him to hear dangers at long distances, and [his
helmet](Small_Riithi_Helmet.md "wikilink") leaves only his ears, mouth
and nose uncovered. He's wearing [a form-fitting
cuirass](Riithi_Granitecloth_Cuirass.md "wikilink") of some stony
fabric, held close by [a wide leather belt](Riithi_Belt.md "wikilink").
[Gray leather boots](Pair_Of_Riithi_Work_Boots.md "wikilink") cover his
feet.*
