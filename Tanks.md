*The term "tank" is used to define the member of a group (usually a
[warrior](:Category:_Warriors.md "wikilink") or fighter type), who
initiates combat and attempts to absorb all of the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink")' damage. Typically a group will
also contain a [cleric/healer](Healers.md "wikilink") type, as well as
[extra firepower](Hitters.md "wikilink").*

See also [Healers](Healers.md "wikilink") and
[Hitters](Hitters.md "wikilink").
