*The term "tank" is used to define the member of a group (usually a
[warrior](:Category:_Warriors "wikilink") or fighter type), who
initiates combat and attempts to absorb all of the
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink")' damage. Typically a group will also
contain a [cleric/healer](Healers "wikilink") type, as well as [extra
firepower](Hitters "wikilink").*

See also [Healers](Healers "wikilink") and
[Hitters](Hitters "wikilink").
