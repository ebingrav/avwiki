*Clad in fine silken robes, in colors that span the range of the
rainbow, and sewn with delicate golden threads, the geomancer of
Daingean Machadae and self made queen of Cathracharraig stands before
you. She has the appearance of a young woman in her prime with bright
red hair going down her back in a long braid. Her bright green eyes peer
into the world with a look that could be best described as confident,
yet with a hint of disdain for all around her. Already a skilled
geomancer, her powers have been amplified multiple times by her
plundering of magical relics, most notably the sacred remains of the
dryad Allaysha, and the artifacts won from the late Marshall Diana.*
