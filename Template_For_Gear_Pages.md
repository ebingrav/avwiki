<font color=gray>Select this page's Edit tab above, select all of its
contents, copy them, and then paste them into whatever new gear page you
are creating. Then, simply fill in its blanks and make changes and
deletions as needed. If you can not find certain bits of useful
information, then feel free to submit your new page without these bits
(and with blank spaces or question marks in their place) and, also, to
categorize it as Incomplete. Also, please do not manually "tag" your
contributions with your name; AvatarWiki automatically tracks who
adds/changes/deletes what.</font>

<font color=gray>Each object's page's title should equal its name in
inventory *without* any leading articles (namely A, An, or The) and
*with* every one of its words capitalized. So, for example, a page made
for "the sword of Avatar" would be titled Sword Of Avatar. Pages made
for different objects that share a single name will need to be
"disambiguated" (see our Disambiguation category under Wiki Stuff for
more information about this subject).</font>

<font color=gray>Object description and slots are both determined
through Examine. Object affects, keywords, levels, type, quality,
weight, and flags, are all determined via Identify. Object values are
determined using Examine and/or Identify. Note that, for objects that
come from mobs, some data (such as level range and base-armor-class
range) may be derived from these mobs' levels, which may determined by
identifying their corpses.</font>
