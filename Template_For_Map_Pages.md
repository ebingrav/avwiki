<font color=gray>Select this page's Edit tab above, select all of its
contents, copy them, and then paste them into whatever new map page you
are creating. Then, simply fill in its blanks and make changes and
deletions as needed. Its page's title should be the same as that of the
Wiki category for its area followed by (of course) the word Map. Links
below should be in alphabetical order and should connect map pages for
adjoining areas to each other. Please categorize all new map pages under
both (1) Maps and (2) AreaName. And, of course, don't forget to delete
all of this gray text before saving your new page!</font>
