<font color=gray>Select this page's Edit tab above, select all of its
contents, copy them, and then paste them into whatever new mob page you
are creating. Then, simply fill in its blanks and make changes and
deletions as needed. If you can not find certain bits of useful
information, then feel free to submit your new page without these bits
(and with blank spaces or question marks in their place) and, also, to
categorize it as Incomplete. Also, please do not manually "tag" your
contributions with your name; AvatarWiki automatically tracks who
adds/changes/deletes what.</font>

<font color=gray>Each mob's page's title (with few exceptions like
Aelmon) should equal its name as displayed by Look or Where or such
*without* any leading articles (namely A, An, or The) and *with* every
one of its words capitalized. So, for example, a page made for "the
wildman of Avatar" would be titled Wildman Of Avatar. Pages made for
different mobs that share a single name will need to be "disambiguated"
(see our Disambiguation category under Wiki Stuff for more information
about this subject).</font>

<font color=gray>Mob description is determined by looking at it. Mob
keywords are determined only through trial-and-error; they are often but
not always in its name and/or short description. Mob level is best
determined by killing it and then identifying its corpse. Mob alignment
and flags may both be determined via Bioscan. Some mob affects (like fly
and sanctuary) are visible to everyone; most other affects may be
determined using Bioscan.</font>
