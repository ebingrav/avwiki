I'll make another one, Template:Gear-Room, for items on the ground, and
Template:Gear-Quest, for items obtained from quests. But I've been
working on this one too long, and I'm about to go out now. Will finish
it tomorrow, or monday. --[MooNFisH](User:MooNFisH.md "wikilink") 12:50,

Thanks for your good work on this, MooNFisH! --[Dave

The Gear-Mob template used for this node has a really odd behavior. The
subsections' Edit-links point to
\[avatar.melanarchy.info/index.php?title=Template:Gear-Mob&action=edit&section=1
editing the Gear-Mob template\], which is just wrong. Fix, anyone?

MooNFisH - any time to work on this? I don't know enough about templates
to fix this (if it could). --[Ylem](User:Ylem.md "wikilink") 16:04, 17

It *looks* like
\[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing_sections_of_included_templates
this\] page on Wikipedia talks about this issue - but that is as far as
I got. --[Ylem](User:Ylem.md "wikilink") 16:40, 17 June 2008 (EDT)

Sorry, I don't think there's a fix for this. We'll have to stay on
alert. The only way we can fix this is by disallowing section editing on
each page that uses a template, which is 70-90% of the wiki.
