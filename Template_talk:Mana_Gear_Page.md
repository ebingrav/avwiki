I'm thinking that using this template, instead of the standard one, on
the mana gear pages will make it easy to link in to the individual slot
pages as well. Going to wait on feedback/time before I go ahead and
duplicate it for archer, hit and tank gear. Also has the advantage of
seeing which links need to be worked
