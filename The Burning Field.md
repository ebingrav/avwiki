Located s2e from shift, this is a spot occasionally used to set the
anchor for small exp groups. Like other elemental planes, it's also the
same room which contains the nexus to nowhere. One should note that when
moving to this room, the exits of the plane do not align effectively and
that going, for example, ese will not move you into this room. One
should be careful about using this anchor point, as although it can
frequently be empty, purifying crusaders will move into it every now and
then, and they hit very hard, or sometimes the dreaded crusader/hulk
combo will be present and you may find yourself disarmed and your weapon
stomped before you get out of lag.
