This is the Lloydable room in Karnath Proper, found 2n4e from shift.
While there is the value of boosted regeneration in this room via create
shrine, it's not a recommended place to anchor for regen or shifting
purposes, as the plane of Karnath can be dangerous and it is a 4-exit
room, making it relatively high traffic with mobs including stabbing
mobs. It's recommended to use a corner room rather than this one for
regenning during EXP runs as well.
