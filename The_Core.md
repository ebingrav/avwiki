This is the Lloydable room in Reckoning. It's found w6d from shift at
the intersection of the four elemental realm sections of the area. It is
generally clear as the only mobs that wander in here are the 5 elemental
avatars, and they usually get stuck in the elemental realms. This can
make it a decent shifting point for smaller exp groups, as it gives
access to water proper as well through a simple portal, and a very low
traffic place to regenerate.
