This is the Lloydable room in Noctopia and the only way to shift
directly into the plane.

Anchor is very commonly set to give access to [Noctopia gear
runs](:Category:Gear_In_Noctopia.md "wikilink") without having to go
through the death trap that is [Shiftwatch
Orb](:Category:Shiftwatch_Orb.md "wikilink"). If the anchor is here,
it's advised to NOT move it elsewhere as a large group spent a decent
amount of time setting it here. Be forewarned, when shifting into this
anchorpoint, the ethereal stalkers will begin hunting those that shift
in. They hit extremely hard and bash liberally to boost theirs and other
mobs' damage.

To reach this room from [the
waterfall](:Category:Unravelling.md "wikilink"), the directions are
wnwn4w2n.

The room is identifiable by the mention of the shiftwatch orb floating
above you in the room description, in case you get lost and do not have
detect haven available.

It is a noregen room, so while you can shrine it it serves absolutely no
purpose.
