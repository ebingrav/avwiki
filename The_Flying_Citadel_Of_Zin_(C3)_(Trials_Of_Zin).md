You stand in the center of the keep. A strange fountain is here with the
water floating in the air and disappearing before it falls more than a
few feet downward. A tall skinny man in robes is here concentrating on
something unseen. You can wander the courtyard in any direction, go down
through the fountain to the land far below, or you can rest here awhile.
