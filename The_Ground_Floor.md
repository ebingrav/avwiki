This room is in the back center of the first floor of the Dark Pyramid.
This anchor can be set for people to join a crown run already in
progress, or occasionally to aid in CRs. However, shifting into this
room can be incredibly deadly as the mob density in the Dark Pyramid is
very high and it's not uncommong to see 5-6 mobs in this room. Also, for
regeneration purposes it can be used as you will have cleared out much
of the first floor, but it's generally better to make your way near the
first gear room before regenerating, and this is still a number of rooms
off and in poor position should a repop occur.
