*No flesh remains upon the lich's skeleton. The bones are a pristine
white,*similar to the walls of the tower. Twin points of blue light gaze
from the *orbits. The lich's heavily embroidered robes are cut in an
ancient style,*but still possess the original deep blue coloring.

''Raising a bony hand, the lich welcomes everybody.

*"Long have I waited here, watching realms and rulers come and go as the
river*of time flowed on. This I did in isolation, deep within the
mountain now *called Devil's Peak. Then one day, elemental water started
rushing into my*cavern, and my isolation was ended. The demon Tssasskkas
claims this cavern *as hers, leaving minions to harass me, but lairing
elsewhere. She seeks the*knowledge from my library, which cannot be.
Many have come to my defense; *some have succeeded in slowing
Tssasskkas, many have fallen and now serve her.*May you be amongst those
who survive."

*The skeleton goes still, and the twin lights fade slightly. It will
speak no*more at this time.

Oddly, this mob does not have 'lich' or 'Tzzan' as keywords. In safe
room with [ Tzzan's Spirit](Spirit_Of_The_Lich.md "wikilink").
