*This [dwarf](Dwarves.md "wikilink") has been
[Steadfast](Steadfast_(mob).md "wikilink")'s companion in guarding the
lower passes of [Mt Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr.md "wikilink") for over
fifty years. There'sa is neither a great thinker or talker, preferring
to listen to [Steadfast](Steadfast_(mob).md "wikilink")'s incessant
chatter. In fact, it is rumoured There'sa once went 2 years without
saying anything, except to laugh at
[Steadfast](Steadfast_(mob).md "wikilink")'s idle banter. Originally
named Goodfellow, he's been called There'sa for as long as he can
remember, the name coming from
[Steadfast](Steadfast_(mob).md "wikilink")'s nickname for him. "Get me a
drink, there's a good fellow!"*
