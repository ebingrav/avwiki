*This [dwarf](Dwarves "wikilink") has been
[Steadfast](Steadfast_(mob) "wikilink")'s companion in guarding the
lower passes of [Mt Durr](:Category:_Mt_Durr "wikilink") for over fifty
years. There'sa is neither a great thinker or talker, preferring to
listen to [Steadfast](Steadfast_(mob) "wikilink")'s incessant chatter.
In fact, it is rumoured There'sa once went 2 years without saying
anything, except to laugh at [Steadfast](Steadfast_(mob) "wikilink")'s
idle banter. Originally named Goodfellow, he's been called There'sa for
as long as he can remember, the name coming from
[Steadfast](Steadfast_(mob) "wikilink")'s nickname for him. "Get me a
drink, there's a good fellow!"*
