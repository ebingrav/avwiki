*This [command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") allows the user to
throw [weapons](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") at their foes. In
order to use this [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink"), you must
have a specialized [throwing
weapon](:Category:_Throwing_Weapons.md "wikilink") readied; standard
[weapons](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") tend to be awkward and
unwieldy to throw. If you're looking for the
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") where you throw an opponent on
the ground, you're in the wrong place; for that skill, see
[TOSS](Toss.md "wikilink"). [Throwing
weapons](:Category:_Throwing_Weapons.md "wikilink") come in an
incredible variety, and some even have unique special abilities. You
will need to [wield](Wield.md "wikilink") these items to throw them. You
can only throw from your offhand if both your
[wielded](Wield.md "wikilink")
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons.md "wikilink") and the projectile are light
enough, based on your level of prowess with the ambidexterity skills
([poise](Poise.md "wikilink"), [balance](Balance.md "wikilink"), etc.)
[Examining](Examine.md "wikilink") a [throwing
weapon](:Category:_Throwing_Weapons.md "wikilink") with [weapon
lore](Weapon_Lore.md "wikilink") will reveal its damage and special
attributes.*
