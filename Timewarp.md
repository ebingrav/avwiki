Syntax: c timewarp Prerequisites: None

Warp time, my friend, and reap the double edged sword of faster
degeneration on things close to yourself...magic! Timewarp will make
your spell duration decrease at twice the normal speed. For now it is a
spell better kept secret so it is only possible to cast on oneself.

This is a SUSTAINED spell. Any command or movement will cause the caster
to lose the spell before its duration is complete.

NOTE: It doesn't affect the degeneration of items or racial fatigues.
