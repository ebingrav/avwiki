*Once, a long time ago, Tinderhand walked the lands beyond the Wildwood.
The land was a different place back then, the Great Wall only freshly
built and he walked in forests now gone, to the edge of the world, and
then he walked back again. Dissatisfied with what he saw, he vowed to
travel no more beyond the sacred lands and to guard them with his life.
With rather intractable views on what exactly constitutes a threat to
the Heartwood, let entish enemies beware.*
