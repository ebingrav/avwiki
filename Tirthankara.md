*The Tirthankara wears only a brown kilt and his extremely muscular body
is golden in color. His ears seem to be longer, and touch his shoulders
while his hair comes to a small spiral on the top of his head. His eyes
are alight with the fire of rage. He is very displeased. The yakshas
have abused the power they were given, and now they must pay.*
