Syntax: title <string>

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a title when your character is created. You can use
TITLE to set your title to something else. This title is seen beside
your name on the who list, and it normally appears beside your name when
a player "looks" in a room.

Titles are subject to our language policy and are limited to 50
characters, include color codes.

If you're feeling especially uncreative, you can always type "title"
without offering any suggestions of your own. You will find yourself
with a new, shiny, and possibly intelligible title all of your own!
