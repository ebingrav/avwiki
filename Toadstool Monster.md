*Seeing you, it bellows loudly!*

*Looking like a toad, but with the size and stature of a bear this is
one of the strangest and ugliest creatures you have ever seen. It's
gaping maw is lined with razor sharp teeth. What look like toadstools
are growing from its lumpy brown skin. It makes a constant growling
grunting noise, punctuated by an occasional belch. Judging by the bones
scattered around it the goblins have made some unsuccessful attempts to
dislodge this creature.*
