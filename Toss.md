*With toss, you can physically grab your opponent and slam them into the
ground. If you're successful, they'll be lying on the ground in a prone
position, and will be slow in recovering. You can get more hits in this
way, and since their [armor class](Armor_Class "wikilink") is worse your
hits may be more devastating. If you are thrown, it will take you a
[round](Rounds "wikilink") or two to recover.*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: toss <character>.

## Notes

After a successful toss, the first person to attack the mob will become
the mobs new target. Toss a great way to rescue at lowmort if you don't
have rescue, but can also cause problematic effects if someone were to
cast a spell or smash after a toss.

When a Monk has [Tiger Stance](Tiger_Stance "wikilink") activated, it
will hit the mob immediately after tossing it. This is handy way for a
monk to have a mob target them when they don't want to rescue (e.g. when
a Paladin is doing rescue healing).
