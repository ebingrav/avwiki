This is a variable insignia that can be activated upon completion of
[Restoring Mark V (Part 2)
Quest](Restoring_Mark_V_(Part_2)_Quest "wikilink") that takes place in
[Glyntaff Pass](:Category:Glyntaff_Pass.md "wikilink") and many other
locations.

When visiting an eligible room and wielding the quest weapon, you may be
shown a special message indicating that it's an activation room. IIRC
this message mentions something about a glimmering in the air -- and it
reportedly may not be shown during the night time??

Depending on the place of activation and depending on the time of day,
bonuses can vary. Remember not to lose the weapon from [Restoring Mark V
(Part 1) Quest](Restoring_Mark_V_(Part_1)_Quest "wikilink") as wielding
it is required when performing the activation.
