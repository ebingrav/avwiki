*Wearing a large tunic with the symbol of Machadae,this guard takes his
job seriously. He was instructed to stand guard and that is what he
does. His large body obstructs the passage, and his beady little eyes
look at everything and everyone suspiciously.  
His large hands grab a tighter grip on the club he is wielding, as he
comes closer to find out who you are, and why you dare to stand in front
of him.*

## Gear

`The tower guard is using:`  
<wielded>`           a barbed club`

`You peek at the inventory:`  
`     (Glowing) standard looking key`

## Comments

A few of these mobs pop, I think, and only one holds the key. The
glowing standard looking key opens the doors to the [Rock
Golem](Rock_Golem "wikilink") and [Mithril
Lion](Mithril_Lion "wikilink").
