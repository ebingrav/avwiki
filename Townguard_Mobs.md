[Mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") of this
[type](:Category:_Mob_Types "wikilink") will hunt and attack
[outlawed](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink")
[characters](:Category:_Characters "wikilink"). They will immediately
arrest any [outlaws](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink") that they find in [safe
rooms](Safe_Rooms "wikilink") without a fight and send these
[outlaws](Outlaw_Flag "wikilink") to [jail](Jail_Rooms "wikilink") for
sentencing. If a character is not outlawed but possess a GOOD alignment,
a townguard will intervene in a fight in the player's favor (and steal
their xp by terming the mob, more often than not). If a character has an
EVIL alignment, the guard will attack the player instead, with the
intention of killing them. (If the player is on the bigger side and
survives more than one round against the guard, he will be deemed an
outlaw and arrested. Moral of the story: avoid fighting in lawful cities
if you're evil.)
