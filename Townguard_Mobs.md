[Mobs](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") of this
[type](:Category:_Mob_Types.md "wikilink") will hunt and attack
[outlawed](Outlaw_Flag.md "wikilink")
[characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink"). They will immediately
arrest any [outlaws](Outlaw_Flag.md "wikilink") that they find in [safe
rooms](Safe_Rooms.md "wikilink") without a fight and send these
[outlaws](Outlaw_Flag.md "wikilink") to [jail](Jail_Rooms.md "wikilink")
for sentencing. If a character is not outlawed but possess a GOOD
alignment, a townguard will intervene in a fight in the player's favor
(and steal their xp by terming the mob, more often than not). If a
character has an EVIL alignment, the guard will attack the player
instead, with the intention of killing them. (If the player is on the
bigger side and survives more than one round against the guard, he will
be deemed an outlaw and arrested. Moral of the story: avoid fighting in
lawful cities if you're evil.)
