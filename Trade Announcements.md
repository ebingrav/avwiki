Whenever you post an item for trade on [Debonair's auction
boards](http://avatar.7thfire.com/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php) feel free to
make an announcement here. Just follow these simple guidelines:

-   Create a new subsection of this page for your auction. Do this by
    starting your announcement with === Auction Title ===
-   Follow this header with a brief description of your item and what
    you're looking for. Be sure to mention all relevant details
-   Don't post announcements of lord auctions here. If there's interest
    we can create another page like this one on the [lord
    wiki](http://lord.melanarchy.info).
-   Please help keep this page neat & tidy. Remove your old postings
    after the sale/trade is complete.

### Example announcement
