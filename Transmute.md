*Over time, [Psionicists](:Category:_Psionicists "wikilink") have
learned many ways to change things on a molecular level. Transmute
doesn't turn lead into gold, but you can make a small change to an
[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")'s overall
[weight](Object_Weight "wikilink"). Transmute is not a perfect
[spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink"), and there is a small chance the
[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") will be destroyed, or otherwise
permanently mangled. [Magic](Magic_Flag "wikilink")
[items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") are more or less impossible to
alter molecularly without causing enormous explosions of light and
power. This [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") will not work on any
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") with a [magic
flag](Magic_Flag "wikilink"). Note that transmute itself is a magical
process, so any [item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") can only be
transmuted once. NOTE: If successful, transmute will add 1 or 2
[levels](Object_Level "wikilink") to an
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink"). NOTE:
[Containers](:Category:_Containers "wikilink") destroyed also destroy
all contents.*

Prerequisite(s): [Steel Skeleton](Steel_Skeleton "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'transmute'
\<[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")\> <heavier/lighter>.
