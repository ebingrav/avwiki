Many popular MUD clients allow users to script actions to be taken after
some event; these are commonly known as triggers.

Before creating or using any triggers please read HELP TRIGGER ABUSE

On AVATAR, there are the following rules regarding the use of triggers.

Purely informational triggers are permissible when AFK.

Spellup triggers are permissible even if AFK providing that:

-   They are open to everyone. You cannot exclude people or limit them
    to your group and buddyset.

<!-- -->

-   They are interesting, Snikt wants them to be and might kill you if
    they are not. However, interesting doesn't mean spammy.

<!-- -->

-   We reserve the right to ask you to stop if you are being excessively
    spammy with the triggers themselves or advertising them.

ALL other legal trigger types require you to be at your keyboard and
able to quickly respond to an Immortal.

All triggers not previously mentioned are permitted except

-   triggers which generate output on public channels
-   triggers which invoke the 'hog' command
-   triggers that allow you to gather gold, gear, or any other item
    without interaction.

Triggers used only for other purposes are allowed.

And no trigger may ever

-   repeat on herochat everything Snikt says, but backwards and in
    purple
-   type 'hog' for you

However, as long as you are at your computer, it is perfectly fine to
have a trigger which will

-   brandish a staff of detect hidden at any time
-   eat a pot pie whenever you tingle a skill
-   cheer every time you finish combat

Combat triggers are allowed but you must be at your computer when using
them and able to respond quickly to an Immortal.

Combat triggers includes rescue triggers, weapon pick up triggers and
those that trigger off the leaders kill emotes.
