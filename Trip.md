*A successful use of the trip [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink")
means you will duck down, swing your legs around and knock your opponent
off their feet. A player may attempt to trip at any time. It can be used
to start a fight or in the middle of one. A tripped opponent will be
weakened as they are on the ground. Trip cannot be used against
[flying](Flying_Flag.md "wikilink") opponents as their legs are not on
the ground. Be careful however, as the [tank](Tanks.md "wikilink") can
be switched after the opponent is tripped. TRIP is an auxiliary fighting
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") to weaken your opponent.
All that is required is that you must [practice](Practice.md "wikilink")
the [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") and that the opponent is
not [flying](Flying_Flag.md "wikilink").*

Prerequisite(s): none.

Syntax: trip \<[mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink")\>.

Trip is a quirky skill whose affects depend on who has relogged or
repopped most recently. If you are "on top" of a mob (meaning you
relogged since it repopped) then your next melee attack will deal
greater damage to the mob. If, on the other hand, the mob is on top then
it will lose its next round of melee attacks.

It's very important to understand that trip can change who is
[tanking](Tanks.md "wikilink") a mob if you use it in a group. If you
trip and someone in your group performs a midround attack (such as a
[mage](:Category:Mages.md "wikilink") casting an offensive spell) then
the mob will stop fighting the tank and start attacking them. Even if no
one performs a midround attack, trip will cause the person on top of the
group to begin tanking the mob. This can be particularly useful for
groups whose tank can't [rescue](Rescue.md "wikilink"). In summary, only
use trip in a group if you're on top and no one is using midround
attacks.

At one point in the past you could trip a mob every round. Nowadays it
will only work once every 15 rounds or so on the same mob.
