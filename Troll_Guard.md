*Standing between you and the stairs up to the tower is one lean, mean
looking troll. Well, maybe not lean. But he does look mean. His eyes
stand rather close together, and his mouth is filled with wicked looking
teeth. His dark-grey leathery skin is covered with a black chainmail
suit. He eyes you suspiciously as he tries to figure out what you are
doing here.*
