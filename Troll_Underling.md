*Standing tall at ten feet, with arms and legs the size of trees, this
is a foe to be reckoned with. He is sharpening his weapon at this
moment, and trying to stay clear from his mistress, Tanna Machadae.  
Apparently she is in one of her whimsical moods again and the last thing
he wants to happen is that she turns him into a rock just for her
pleasure. He licks the sharp side of his weapon to see if it is sharp
enough yet. Content he flashes a crooked grin when suddenly he notices
you.*

## Comments

There is a second, unarmed Troll underling located in The armory. It has
the description

*Standing tall at ten feet, with arms and legs the size of trees, this  
is a foe to be reckoned with. Lezgnar, the troll boss, gave him the  
rather tedious assignment of keeping an eye out on the various weapons  
gathered here. The last couple of days the various troll and ogre
patrols  
have been hoarding more and more from the surrounding lands and now
the  
boss is afraid that if the underlings walk around armed, and there is  
nothing to do they will start fighting amongst themselves  
and none will stay alive..  
As a result this one is sitting here, bored out of his ugly head
staring  
at the walls and fiddling around with the blades.*
