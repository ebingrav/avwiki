*This prized sword was won by Chalmus long ago in a magician's duel. The
three sharp edges of the blade taper together into a needlelike point.
The length of this epee is well balanced by its weight, allowing you to
manuever it about quickly while keeping your foes at bay. Your hand
naturally forms a sturdy grip around the handle, which is carved out of
thick moose antler.*
