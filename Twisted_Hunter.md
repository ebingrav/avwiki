*Sneering at your approach the hunters hands take a better grip on [the
bow he is wearing](Old_Bow.md "wikilink"). But obviously the feel of
[the bow](Old_Bow.md "wikilink") annoys the man even more than your
presence, and after a short moment a cold smile steals onto his lips.
'So. Did the [druids](:Category:_Druids.md "wikilink") tell you about
me? The malicious one? Well, they sure are in need of some assistance
and I will take less of their 'lovely' shimmering deer than those beasts
that fell to my arrow. - And NO, not [this bow](Old_Bow.md "wikilink").
One of those [stone tricksters](Stone_Trickster.md "wikilink") broke my
good one. But here we are... If you could help me to get [the
string](Long_Black_Tentacle_String.md "wikilink") I still need to
fashion [my new bow](Longbow_Christened_'True_Sight'.md "wikilink"), it
should not be to your disadvantage. By tarterus, I even would make you
one as well. Yet there is a catch. I need
[something](Large_Egg.md "wikilink") to lure forward that [black thin
'thing'](Thin_Black_Tentacle.md "wikilink") that I have seen creeping
through the gaps between the boulders. It just looks 'perfect' to be a
string on a new bow... What are you still waiting for? Go, get
[something](Large_Egg.md "wikilink"). It seems to like flesh, or blood,
or the like. Judging by the debris here...*'
