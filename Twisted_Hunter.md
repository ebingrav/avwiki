*Sneering at your approach the hunters hands take a better grip on [the
bow he is wearing](Old_Bow "wikilink"). But obviously the feel of [the
bow](Old_Bow "wikilink") annoys the man even more than your presence,
and after a short moment a cold smile steals onto his lips. 'So. Did the
[druids](:Category:_Druids "wikilink") tell you about me? The malicious
one? Well, they sure are in need of some assistance and I will take less
of their 'lovely' shimmering deer than those beasts that fell to my

tricksters](Stone_Trickster "wikilink") broke my good one. But here we
are... If you could help me to get [the
string](Long_Black_Tentacle_String "wikilink") I still need to fashion
[my new bow](Longbow_Christened_'True_Sight' "wikilink"), it should not
be to your disadvantage. By tarterus, I even would make you one as well.
Yet there is a catch. I need [something](Large_Egg "wikilink") to lure
forward that [black thin 'thing'](Thin_Black_Tentacle "wikilink") that I
have seen creeping through the gaps between the boulders. It just looks
'perfect' to be a string on a new bow... What are you still waiting for?
Go, get [something](Large_Egg "wikilink"). It seems to like flesh, or
blood, or the like. Judging by the debris here...*'
