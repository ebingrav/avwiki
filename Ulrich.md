## Comments

Ulrich is a big nasty mob in [Hamlet of
Kreigstadt](:Category:_Hamlet_Of_Kreigstadt.md "wikilink").

Ulrich is a popular [shopkeeper](:Category:_Shopkeepers.md "wikilink")
for [heroes](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") because he can buy all
[sorts](:Category:_Object_Types.md "wikilink") of
[gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink"), unlike the
[armourer](Armourer.md "wikilink") or
[weaponsmith](Weaponsmith.md "wikilink") of
[Midgaard](:Category:_Midgaard.md "wikilink"), who both specialize in a
certain [type](:Category:_Object_Types.md "wikilink") of
[equipment](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink").

Ulrich is portable and not [aggie](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink").
Because of this, he serves as a useful portal point to many areas
connected to [Wildwood](:Category:_Wildwood.md "wikilink"), such as
[Githzerai Tower](:Category:_Githzerai_Tower.md "wikilink") and [Cavern
of the Fates](:Category:_Cavern_Of_The_Fates.md "wikilink").

Because of his [level](Level.md "wikilink"), and the fact that he uses
spells midround, he is a popular practice mob for
[heroes](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") who aspire to kill the [Ultimate
Dragon](Ultimate_Dragon.md "wikilink"). However, despite Ulrich's
[size](Level.md "wikilink"), he is not quite as big as the
[UD](Ultimate_Dragon.md "wikilink"). Update: The UD is actually level 88
or so, so Ulrich is bigger. What makes the UD harder, besides the
unavailability of the surge skill and having to self-spell prior to the
fight, is his racial armorancient, racial tail, and breath attacks
(which occur more frequently than Ulrich's mage-type spellcasting).

[Heroes](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") often intentionally die to
Ulrich. Sometimes this is done to clear [spells](Affects.md "wikilink"),
so the rest of their group don't have to wait for them to tick off.
[Sorcerers](:Category:_Sorcerers.md "wikilink") who make use of [Tainted
Genius](Tainted_Genius.md "wikilink") also used to intentionally kill
themselves as this used to clear the spell exhaust (note that it no
longer does). Ulrich is a good [mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink") to
die to because 1) he's huge, 2) he's in an uncursed room, and 3) he's
not [aggie](Aggressive_Mobs.md "wikilink"), and so, he won't kill you
again.

Because [heroes](:Category:_Hero.md "wikilink") love fighting Ulrich so
much, and because of the fact that he uses area spells, it is not a good
idea to [sleep](Sleep_(command).md "wikilink") in his
[room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink"). If you're sleeping there and
someone starts a fight with him you may find yourself on the cloud
before you know it.
