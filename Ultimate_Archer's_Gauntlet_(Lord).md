## The "Quest"

Assuming you have a [Girth Of The Most
Holy](Girth_Of_The_Most_Holy "wikilink"), a hero version of the
gauntlet, and are willing to blow two halves of a [Once-Sundered
Ring](Once-Sundered_Ring "wikilink") - go ahead and make one. Then give
the hero gauntlet to Miloslava, followed by the ring and you get to pick
one of the three options:

1.  Get improved held skill (which presumably does more damage) - a
    sweet choice except that held arrow does about half damage as
    constant scattering does. It can also be interrupted for 20 seconds
    of stun, unlike scattershot.
2.  Get improved scattershot skill - the regular choice for fusiliers
    and those archers that want to burn tons of ammo for the rest of
    their careers (which they should be doing).
3.  Get improved aimed shot - available to everyone but intended for
    assassins. Picking this on a fus or perma-archer is unwise.

## Comments

Your hero Gauntlet will be modified and not a new copy. The level is
updated to 128 (no need to alter it further) and base is set to 27. It's
a small mercy considering the overall mediocreness of this piece of
gear - compared to the boon a [Once-Sundered
Ring](Once-Sundered_Ring "wikilink") is to virtually any other class.
Also, unfortunately, the object's Quality rating doesn't get updated to
500/500 as is standard for lord armor.

One final note - your etches from hero version are preserved. If you are
using etching systems that differ between hero and lord, you will have
to grit your teeth some more.
