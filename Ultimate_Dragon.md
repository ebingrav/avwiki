Ultimate Dragon is the sole denizen of this area, and defeating him is
very tough. Read below on some tips and strategies.

## General and Maze Strategies

-   To start the UD fight with the automaton: Follow Caller at Sanctum N

<!-- -->

-   No outside effects are permitted from the quest start, which
    includes turning in of the quest (bless for example) tokens. However
    items the player brings in himself are permissible with no
    restrictions (quest potions, wands of restore, etc.). The exception
    to this rule are the Blood Ritual vials Sorcerers can produce. Vials
    with a metallic name (copper, silver, gold, shimmering gold), which
    heal a significant amount of hit points, are not allowed.
-   To ensure no affects are present, the Immortal which runs the quest
    will cast [Ablution](Ablution "wikilink") on you - before the quest
    is started. This will clear all spells and their affects, and remove
    all gear, so remember to immediately reequip mana gear (if
    necessary).
-   The timer starts once the player leaves the starting room and goes
    *north*. If 30 minutes lapse and the Dragon is not dead yet - it is
    an automatic loss.
-   The Maze is most easily completed by dropping a single coin in it's
    first room. **You need to remember to bring at least one coin with
    you!** Alternatively, dropping any item in your possession will work
    as well.
-   If you get the The room to the X is currently private it means you
    are in the first room and you are going in a direction that would
    lead you back to the first room but can't because you are already in
    it.
-   After the starting room is marked with this coin, go through each
    direction until you find the exit that **does not** lead back to the
    first room with the coin. Make sure to write this exit down. Repeat
    this procedure for every subsequent room - you will have to start
    from the first room each time you find an incorrect exit. Note:
    There are approximately 15 rooms (excluding the first and
    penultimate ones).
-   The last room of the maze is unique and the UD will appear on scan -
    this room can be used to self-spell.
-   Self-spelling depends on the class, but most classes will lack
    [Invincibility](Invincibility "wikilink"),
    [Barkskin](Barkskin "wikilink") and/or [Steel
    Skeleton](Steel_Skeleton "wikilink"). These can be bought in shops
    or retrieved by turning in [Approval From Your
    Ambassadors](Approval_From_Your_Ambassador "wikilink"). For the
    other missing spells use the [Suggested Spellcasting
    Gear](Suggested_Spellcasting_Gear "wikilink") page to find
    replacements.
-   **Be sure to familiarize yourself with your classes self-spelling
    capabilities.**

## UD Fight

The UD himself is a level 88 npc. However, he is obviously much harder
than typical mobs of this level due to racial armorancient,
significantly more HPs, a painful and frequently-deployed breath attack,
frequent tailing, and a decent capacity for meting out melee damage. How
hard the fight will be hinges on the player's skill as much as the
random nature of how many tails the dragon will dispense. 3-4
consecutive tails, lagging the player for as much as 6-7 rounds, are not
uncommon. Be loaded for bear when you try this quest.

Every class has a different UD, in terms of general health. Warriors,
for example, face a much beefier opponent than archers. However, the UD
is beatable through a clever optimization of three factors:

1.  HR/DR
2.  AC
3.  Saves

While in common gear setups (such as DR hitset, HR hitset, AC tankset)
saves are largely ignored, a simple addition of -100 in Saves vs Magic
(through, for example two [Namure's Leather
Collars](Namure's_Leather_Collar "wikilink")) can make a difference of
five thousand hp worth of damage received less from breath attacks alone
(during a warrior fight).

As such, familiarize yourself with [Hero Saving-Throw
Gear](:Category:Hero_Saving-Throw_Gear.md "wikilink") (though generally,
two Namure Collars will be sufficient), and replacement mix-gear that
combines AC with HR/DR. See [Tanking In Hit
Gear](Tanking_In_Hit_Gear "wikilink") for some common alternative gear
pieces. Of note are the [Lizardskin
Jerkin](Lizardskin_Jerkin "wikilink"), [Darklinscale
Lamellar](Darklinscale_Lamellar "wikilink"), [Mega's Spark In A
Bottle](Mega's_Spark_In_A_Bottle "wikilink"), [Smoldering Crown Of Dying
Fire](Smoldering_Crown_Of_Dying_Fire "wikilink") and [Orkenfyr Signet
Ring](Orkenfyr_Signet_Ring "wikilink"), depending on weather you will be
trading HR or DR for the AC.

For non-caster classes (casters are too busy casting to quaff potions) -
healing is done from the start by drinking *double-healies* such as
[Glacial Milk](Glacial_Milk "wikilink"), [Herbal
Remedy](Herbal_Remedy "wikilink"), or if possible, divinity pots such as
[Panacea](Panacea "wikilink") or the [Red-Brown Vial Of
Healing](Red-Brown_Vial_Of_Healing "wikilink") which can be found in
lockboxes. For this reason, it is wise to collect and lockpick [Small
Wooden Lockboxes](Small_Wooden_Lockbox "wikilink") during the course of
the game, and store the Red-Brown potions for UD fight consumption.

All potions (including quest) are legal as they do not require Immortal
assistance to use. Exception: higher potency [blood
ritual](Blood_Ritual.md "wikilink") potions (copper+).

## Class Strategies

Different classes will use different strategies. Here are some general
notes.

-   Warriors and other brutes cannot use poison and similar. Thus the
    fight will take a long time and some self-preservation should be in
    order. Solid saves, and -1000 AC should be sufficient. Berserkers
    should not ignore AC and self-spelling either, about half a spellup
    can be achieved through replacement pots and pills.

<!-- -->

-   Roguetypes should keep in mind that there is no link refresh in the
    UD arena and that UD will be on top of them. Thus quickstrike is out
    of question, and aside for the initial stab (if successful), there
    is not much to be done outside of poisons and quaffing.

<!-- -->

-   Archertypes should start with poisoned ammo as well, and then switch
    to explosives. As always, high AC and some save spell is
    recommended. Archers will want to use a light crossbow such as the
    [Hardboard_Slinger](Hardboard_Slinger "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   Fusiliers using scattershot will have a very easy time with the UD.
    However note that you cannot acquire the UD Gauntlet as a Fus - Fus
    wanting this item will need to first beat the UD as an Archer and
    then remort/rebirth.

<!-- -->

-   Casters cannot surge but can quicken. Depending on class and race,
    this usually means quickening 4, and reducing to 3, if and when
    appropriate. Full AC and freshly charged shield are suggested, of
    course.

<!-- -->

-   Because UD will be on top a [
    Stormlords](:Category:Stormlords.md "wikilink") usual single-target
    attack spell ([Cloudburst](Cloudburst "wikilink")) will not work.
    Worse, it cannot be [ quickened](Quicken.md "wikilink"). Instead
    they should use (quickened) [Disintegrate](Disintegrate "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   Healers can use charged shields as well, and many times this is in
    fact the primary offensive weapon for these classes. Heal self or
    quaff and keep blocking.

<!-- -->

-   Small characters should bring additional HP gear, and quaff several
    potions before switching into actual HR, DR or AC gear.

<!-- -->

-   Other types such as monks have different strategies - but these
    include using their own skills. It is imperative you are aware of
    your own classes capabilities and weaknesses.

## Practicing

Going to [Ouroborus](Ouroborus "wikilink") in [Lake Of
Tears](:Category:Lake_Of_Tears.md "wikilink") is a good method to gauge
your abilities. Self-spell and see if you can beat one of them using
gear you would use in the actual fight. Remember, however, that UD is
much tougher, and beating two Ouroboruses in a row could be constituted
as a guaranteed success against UD.
