port to moose guard, 3s 2e, give the mistletoe to
[Nostradomoose](Nostradomoose "wikilink"). (this will transport you)  

`You give mistletoe to Nostradomoose.`  
`Nostradomoose looks over the mistletoe and`  
`says, 'Hmmmmm, maybe I can do something with this.'`  
  
`He turns to his crystal ball and pulls`  
`out a mortar and pestle. Grinding the mistletoe to paste he begins`  
`to chant. The world of the crystal ball takes on more focus`  
`and becomes more real than the room you are in.`  
  
`Suddenly there is the sound of roaring flames and the`  
`smell of smoke.`

**Walk** to Nostradamoose again (2n 3e), give mask to him to be
transported to a [Nospell](Anti-Magic_Rooms.md "wikilink") aggie zone.  

`You give the Mask of the Green Man to Nostradomoose.`  
`Nostradomoose looks at the the Mask of the Green Man and exclaims,`  
`'Excellent! You have defeated our direst foe.`  
`With the fire spreading, and no Green Man to oppose it,`  
`it will eventually burn the rightful order into the`  
`world.`  
  
`'However, ....'`  
  
`He breaks the mask into sand and scatters it on the sand`  
`painting. 'I see a future in which our own race is limited`  
`by the natural order we have created here.`  
  
`'Our people face one final challenge.  Help them face it well,`  
`and you will be on your way to ultimate power.'`  
  
`The world spins and you are pulled into the painting.`  
  
`You have reached the land of the final challenge.`

find [Wolf Pack Leader](Wolf_Pack_Leader "wikilink") get his [Wolf's
Ear](Wolf's_Ear "wikilink").  
There are wandering aggie wolves, and the Leader flees, so you can spend
some time getting caught up by wolves while trying to chase the Leader.
Using trip or bash helps. Note these are sneak move, so you should have
a means of heightening.

find [Bull Moose](Bull_Moose "wikilink") and give him the ear. (The area
has teleporting exits so it's hard to know where you are, but from the
start of the area, you could get to Bull Moose by heading west some and
then a little south.)

`You give a wolf's ear to Winkle.`  
`Winkle says, 'A good deed!`  
`For aiding our people, I send you to the Ulti-Moose.`  
`If he finds you a worthy opponent, the power will`  
`be yours.'`

This will transport you to [Ultimoose](Ultimoose "wikilink"), who is
aggie. (The ultimoose was not aggie to me. I was sneak move. Consider
shows merciless.) Kill him and claim your
[prize](Ultimoose_Power.md "wikilink").  
quote jove:  
"Aggie hero quest zone, corpse eater, never go up"  
That part about not going up is actually because up exits the area. So
when you are stuck in the wolf zone and TRYING to give up on the quest,
you do want to go up. Once you've killed ulti-moose and looted its
corpse, walk in any direction and it takes you to a room to recall out
of the zone. For a fairly large druid in hitgear, took maybe 15 dheals
or so (maybe less, but bring more) and a couple sanc quaffs to finish
the quest; for a large warrior it took 0 dheals and 1 sanc quaff. I
recommend leaving all your best gear on alts. That way if you die, you
don't cry about it. (Level 240 fdk warrior, 2882HP, wearing all hit gear
except a carb, shroud, smouldering crown, charged shield of heroes, he
took about 12 rounds and took 400hp from me.)(lvl 500 pal, he took about
1200hp)  

## Reset Ultimoose

Alot of people think if you fail the quest(die to ultimoose) you must
wait for a reboot to repop the ear. Contrary to popular belief, the ear
that you must get to reach ultimoose does not repop normally but is not
a once per reboot item. You can force a repop of the ear.  
To do this, visit the Nostradomoose that you'd give the mistletoe to.
Type drink in his room to be transported to another area.  
You guzzle water from the pool of prophecy.

`Your mind swirls with images and fear.`  
`A thousand different futures blend and melt`  
`leaving only the essence of nightmare. You`  
`fall into a coma from which there is no escape,`  
`only pain.`

This area is an arena, you don't die, and you don't kill mobs, you get
defeated or defeat mobs. In this area is another Wolf leader and like
the first Wolf leader area it is nospell. Defeat him, then get yourself
defeated, and then leave the area. If you wait for the area to repop
before you go back in, the area will repop with a wolf leader with a
brand new ear. Can also drink in one of the rooms to go back to cloud.
