## Comments

Mobs in the room are aggressive and hard-hitting. The mob with the gear,
Alsebra, is a dragon and will tail. The other mob that can be found in
the room is [Byron of Saint](Byron_Of_Saint.md "wikilink"), and he's
also tough.  
There is a gf'd version of this weapon at lowmort level, which could be
found at the same weight (and thus a good smash) but was perhaps lvl42
and max damage 40. It was a HR8 DR 4 weapon.
