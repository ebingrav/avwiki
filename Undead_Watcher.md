## First Watcher

*This watcher's skin is as translucent as her desire to serve Veyah,
though there are no veins to be seen under her skin, just bones and eye
sockets. There's an old saying that there is ice in some people's veins,
and here it is true; when this soldier was brought back to "life" Veyah
had a notion to add the ice simply to accent her frozen domain.*

**Scan Description:** With iced veins, this watcher has enough reason to
coldly kill trespassers.

## Second Watcher

*Part of this watcher thinks this might be his punishment for the
actions he committed in his former life. For he could rationalize that
it was those same immoral actions that brought him to Veyah's attention,
made him look like a good choice after he was murdered in retribution by
his fellow villagers for his betrayal of Lloth.*
