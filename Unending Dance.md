**Syntax:** stance unending dance  
''While performing an Unending Dance, you do not deplete your defenses
when you dodge. Other defensive skills, such as parry, still deplete as
normal. In addition, you gain a dodge attempt against trip and toss
attacks.

As with all Bladedancer dances, this skill costs mana to activate, and
only functions if the user is wielding identical weapons.

A bladedancer who dances the unending dance while in a bladetrance will
benefit from the swift intuition of the trance by dodging the attacks of
her enemies with greater success. The deeper the trance, the greater her
ability to dodge will become.

The effects of this dance may be enhanced by training in the art of the
[Ocean Weave](ocean_weave "wikilink") and [Echo
Weave](echo_weave "wikilink").''

**Prerequisite(s):** [Sublime Grace](Sublime_Grace "wikilink"),

**See also:** [bladedance](bladedance "wikilink"), [echo
