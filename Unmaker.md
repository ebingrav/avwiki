*Behind the maw you can make out some semblance of a body, coated in a
black, oily substance, armed with short, vestigial limbs. Feeding from
the littler [Chaos Beasts](Chaos_Beast "wikilink"), this abomination has
been drawing off the disintegrating energies of both
[Arcadia](:Category:Arcadia "wikilink") and
[Noctopia](:Category:Noctopia "wikilink"). The Faerie Essence of both
realms churns in its belly, covering it in a vibrating aura of resonant
energy. Anyone who doesn't possess a matching energy signature may not
be able to survive even its slightest touch.*

**Scan Description:** Coruscating light surrounds a gaping maw.

## Gear

Killing the Unmaker will get you a [Faerie
Essence](Faerie_Essence "wikilink").

The Unmaker utters the words, 'DRAIN ESSENCE'.  
You feel your inner strength leach away, empowering the Unmaker!

The Unmaker utters the words, 'REND ESSENCE'.  
the Unmaker's hit strikes Shakti with \*DESTRUCTIVE\* brutality!  
The Unmaker's hit hits you with \*\*\*ANNIHILATING\*\*\* brutality!  
the Unmaker's hit strikes ZiEL with ANNIHILATING brutality!  
the Unmaker's hit strikes Cyzarine with MASSACRING viciousness!  
*and here's a bit from Waite's POV*:

You surge your spell! (x5)  
You maelstrom the Unmaker with DISMEMBERING intensity!  
Kills everyone but HiE, and non-HiE can't touch the thing. To make
matters worse, those nasty essence spells don't seem to exhaust the
Unmaker. Definitely need a handful of HiE who know what they're doing to
take this thing down. If you can kill the Unmaker you get a [Faerie
Essence](Faerie_Essence "wikilink"). Note that the Unmaker is now
confirmed as NOT reboot only. Farm away :)

## Directions

The [Unravelling](:Category:Unravelling "wikilink") maze has random
exits, but the maze isn't too deep (4-5 rooms?) before you reach the
Unmaker. Both the east and west exits from [Mother
Weaver](Mother_Weaver "wikilink") lead to the first room of the maze.
After that you can't go back to her room, so make sure your group is
well regenned before leaving the safe room. In each subsequent room
there's only one correct direction to proceed.

Turn by Turn Directions

Shift Arcadia 3w2sws2w3d pick d(or go get the key which is a bit north
of the grate through some private rooms, on a fae guard) 5dn11d That
gets you to Mother Weaver. East or west into the maze. Track Unmaker.
Rest all non HiE before moving into the unmaker room. The Unamaker
insta-kills all non HiE, healing him to full in the process. Prs should
augement mass comf as high as he/she can. Unmaker is NOHOG. Unmaker has
racial tranquillity.

Crew required: 1 tank and lots of bang

A large group of at least 15 is required to get to Unmaker. After that
the small group of HiE can handle it. You can set anchor in Noctopia by
going to the lloydable room which is N9UWNWN4W2N from Mother Weaver.
From anchor you can then go 2S4ESESE, ALL D to get back to Mother
Weaver.
