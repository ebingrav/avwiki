*A duergar with one of the largest and bushiest beards you have ever
seen - and when dealing with dwarves that is saying something. You could

for a respected guild, you suppose that it is his duty to impress the
locals - and as beards are important to dwarves, the result is logical.
It defintitely draws your eye.*
