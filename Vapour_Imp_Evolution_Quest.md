tele/portal shipwreck merchant ([island of the
lost](:Category:Island_Of_The_Lost.md "wikilink") area) enter glimmer

With a water imp in group kill all mephits (4) and a special message
will appear and a lever should show on ground. Pull the lever to reveal
a down exit from where you first entered glimmer. (hint, you can just
type exit and go to the room which doesn't have maze in its name to get
to the down, all rooms in maze is connected to this).

Mephits are sanced, but not particularly hard, they can hit a bit
(level: 78).

When you head down you will encounter elementals that are unsanced and
weak.

As you make your way north watch for the entrance to the throne room
name, next room is sorta mean. It has an enormous elemental (keyword:
pretender, scan description: massive, level: 105, caster) and probably a
few elementals (they wander though, I think). You definitely want to
group to bring down this mob, haven't played much with it but would
estimate two biggish casters and the imp tanking as a minimum, more is
better. The Wave Imp must get the first hit on the Pretender to spawn
the orb.

You want to bring the orb from the pretender back to Vincent and evolve.
