There are five thieves in the vaults, one in each area. These can be
skinned into furniture items which Bo'Vul will accept.

The first turn in of a hide type will be rewarded with a fizora.
Subsequent turn ins of the same hide will be rewarded with a ruby unless
the quest has been completed.

Turning in all five hide types gives the player a 25 quest point reward
and a permanent 10% death xp loss reduction insignia and higher rewards
on any future hide turn ins (to include perfect gems).
