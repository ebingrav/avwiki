*While performing the Veil of Blades, the bladedancer weaves a 'veil'
which reduces the focus of their enemies, causing all enemies fighting
the bladedancer's group to find it harder to hit their targets.*

*This dance functions regardless of which member of her group is being
attacked by her foes, and if multiple bladedancers use this dance, then
the effect is somewhat improved.*

*As with all Bladedancer dances, this skill costs mana to activate, and
only functions if the user is wielding identical weapons.*
