*With fire in his eyes and a large broadsword wielded between his two
hands, this guard is a formidable match for those who got this far
alive. His chestnut brown hair is slightly on the long side, and his
face bears a harsh ruggedness that extends into his cold eyes and into
his battle-ready stance, but he is completely silent and unblinking. He
only has one thought in his mind, and that is to protect Veyah.*
