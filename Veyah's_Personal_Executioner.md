*Wielding a large wooden axe, this executioner hefts it as he tests its
weight. It's an action that he has done many times, but there is nothing
else to do but dream of a river of blood spilling from his hands. After
all this time, what use does Veyah have for him now? He hasn't seen her
in a long while, but he hopes to see her again; it would be something to
break the monotony, anyway.*
