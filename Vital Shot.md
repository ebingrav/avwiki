*With this [skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink"), a
[rogue](:Category:_Rogues "wikilink") learns to hit his enemy where it
counts, going for whichever vital or weak area he can. Using this
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") will hit a random vital spot,
causing damage and occasional secondary effects. A piercing
[weapon](:Category:_Weapons "wikilink") is required for this attack.
Vital Shot will work less well against
[mobs](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink") with no real anatomy, like
[Ents](Ents "wikilink") or Elementals or the
[Undead](Undead_Mobs "wikilink"). While these creatures do have weak
spots, they do not have things like lungs. Since vital shot is dependant
on the element of surprise, it can only be used to initiate combat.
[Sneak attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink"), [lethal
aim](Lethal_Aim "wikilink"), and [assassin
sight](Assassin_Sight "wikilink") all augment vital shot in different
ways. You can currently hit: head, heart, lungs, kneecap, and eye.*

Prerequisite(s): [Rogue Lore](Rogue_Lore "wikilink"), [Sneak
Attack](Sneak_Attack "wikilink").

Syntax: [vital](Vital "wikilink")
\<[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink")\>.  
Syntax: [vs](VS "wikilink") \<[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink")\>.  

## Comments

The affects of hitting a specific target appear to be:  
**Head:** Dazed, but I'm not entirely sure what the effect is. It might
stun or lag the mob.  
**Heart:** Additional damage.  
**Lungs:** Weakened, which (I presume; never confirmed it) applies -2
[strength](Strength "wikilink").  
**Kneecap:** Hobbled, which reduces mob's ability to flee, and applies
-2 [dexterity](Dexterity "wikilink").  
**Eye:** Blinded, which blinds the mob and applies -20 [hit
roll](Hit_Roll "wikilink").

There is one additional target, which cannot be aimed, 'a VERY vital'
spot, which worsens the target's AC. See [assassin
sight](Assassin_Sight "wikilink").

With [Quickstrike](Quickstrike "wikilink"), the same spot can be hit
multiple times. Unknown whether or not repeated hits stack their
effects, refresh the existing effect's duration, or simply do nothing.
