*A [centaur](Centaurs "wikilink")
[priest](:Category:_Priests "wikilink") does not seem to notice your
presence here as he is engaged so intensely in conversation with [a
centaur paladin](Centaur_Paladin "wikilink"). "Please, brother," he
says, "this won't take long at all. What I want to show you here in this
glen will astonish you. Plus, you tell me that I've been acting rather
peculiarly ever since that [Odevar](:Category:_Odevar_Hills "wikilink")
[warrior](:Category:_Warriors "wikilink") vanished--and this will help
you to understand why." As he notices your presence, he suddenly becomes
very uncomfortable and seems rather eager to withdraw. You hear his
stomach growl loudly. Something seems to be very unsettling about all of
this.*
