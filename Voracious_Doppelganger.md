*A [centaur](Centaurs.md "wikilink")
[priest](:Category:_Priests.md "wikilink") does not seem to notice your
presence here as he is engaged so intensely in conversation with [a
centaur paladin](Centaur_Paladin.md "wikilink"). "Please, brother," he
says, "this won't take long at all. What I want to show you here in this
glen will astonish you. Plus, you tell me that I've been acting rather
peculiarly ever since that
[Odevar](:Category:_Odevar_Hills.md "wikilink")
[warrior](:Category:_Warriors.md "wikilink") vanished--and this will
help you to understand why." As he notices your presence, he suddenly
becomes very uncomfortable and seems rather eager to withdraw. You hear
his stomach growl loudly. Something seems to be very unsettling about
all of this.*
