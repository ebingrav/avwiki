*You look at the corpse of a dwarf here...*  
*His blood is still very wet, mingled with the dewy grass. Unless the
curse of the Walking Woods is lifted, it will invariably rise again.*

## Description

This quest is for level 20 players, if you are going in solo, or players
in the high teens if grouped. The area is overrun with undead, and
[Captain Balgaar](Captain_Balgaar "wikilink") is dying. The "boss" mob
in the area has the first ticket you need. The prize is the [Stonehall
Hammer](Stonehall_Hammer_(Quest) "wikilink").

Nota bene:

-   [Captain Balgaar](Captain_Balgaar "wikilink") can be found in the
    upper level of the area.
-   The boss is sanced.
-   The boss animates corpses.
-   The [guardian ents](Guardian_Ent "wikilink") in the area are aggie
    and hit hard. Use a [Ring of the Rat](Ring_Of_The_Rat "wikilink") if
    you can't invis yourself. *Seriously!*
-   One ticket is exchanged in this area, but the prize is actually
    awarded in another.
