*A ward is a [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") which [protects an
item](:Category:_Skills_And_Spells_That_Enhance_Gear "wikilink") rather
than a person. There are five wards known to
[mages](:Category:_Mages "wikilink") and four of them can be attempted
with this [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink"). These four are specific
to types of damage, meaning that a [lightning
ward](Lightning-Ward_Flag "wikilink") will not protect an
[item](:Category:_Objects "wikilink") from fire. [Caustic
Wards](Caustic-Ward_Flag "wikilink") protect against damage from acid or
other corrosive spells. Although
[clerics](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink") protest, the idea of wards was
developed by a [mage](:Category:_Mages "wikilink") who envied the
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") given by
[Gods](:Category:_Gods_And_Goddesses "wikilink") on a
[cleric](:Category:_Clerics "wikilink")'s behalf and is said to do
something similar for his highly-prized collection of treasures. NOTE:
Ward raises [level](Object_Level "wikilink") by 1 and may even fail
causing destruction. NOTE:
[Containers](:Category:_Containers "wikilink") destroyed through a
[miscast](Cast "wikilink") also destroy contents.*

Prerequisite(s): [Enchant Armor](Enchant_Armor "wikilink"), [Enchant
Weapon](Enchant_Weapon "wikilink").

Syntax: [cast](Cast "wikilink") 'ward'
\<[object](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")\> <ward-type>

Ward types are [lightning](Lightning-Ward_Flag "wikilink"),
[fire](Fire-Ward_Flag "wikilink"), [ice](Ice-Ward_Flag "wikilink"), and
[caustic](Caustic-Ward_Flag "wikilink").

This [spell](:Category:_Spells "wikilink") is most useful both in
protecting [containers](:Category:_Containers "wikilink") and in
preventing [charged](Charge_Shield "wikilink") shields from damaging
themselves.
