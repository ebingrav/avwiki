Water terrain actually encompasses a few [terrain
types](:Category:_Terrains.md "wikilink").
[Rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") with these [terrain
types](:Category:_Terrains.md "wikilink") will appear cyan to players.

Players must [spend](Movement_Costs.md "wikilink") between one and six
[move points](Move_Points.md "wikilink") to enter (non-magically)
[rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink") with these [terrain
types](:Category:_Terrains.md "wikilink").

Also, players must either be flying or carry a
[boat](:Category:_Boats.md "wikilink") to enter (non-magically) some
such [rooms](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink").

You can't [flee](Flee.md "wikilink") from a water room, but you can
[recall](Recall.md "wikilink") out of combat.
