*This magical hammer has been at the bottom of the sea for a very long
time. Patterns made of corals have been traced in the never-rusting
iron, and the hammer still radiates with a solid hum. As you examine the
hammer you hear distant sounds of battle and can almost see all the
crushed skulls that fell beneath this weapon's mighty blows.*
