Go see [Tannah](Tannah_Machadae "wikilink") in the [Daingean
Machadae](:Category:Daingean_Machadae "wikilink") and be prepared to
fight. Bring friends as I doubt you can win alone. As soon as you enter
and she notices a dti, she'll talk and then summon 2 Earth Elementals to
help her fight you. Tannah doesn't aggie, so don't bother attacking her
before her elementals are dead (unless you're trying to blitz her and
flee from her summoned mobs afterward---but that hurts just as much as
killing her elementals first). Note that if Tannah moves whilst you are
fighting the elementals, when you follow her she will summon two more
elementals as you enter the room. When she summons, an Orb of Silt will
appear upon her. Loot it from her corpse after she dies. To evolve, you
have to give it to Vincent when you're level 250. Unfortunately, it is a
key item so you cannot save with it. So it is propbably best to do it
after you hit 250.
