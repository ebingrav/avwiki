From 'help Wayside Kobold Slayer':

*If you have ever visited the northern edge of Wayside, you might find
yourself standing outside of a lovely white house with a well-manicured
yard in front of it.*

*...and a string of expletives flowing from it.*

*Owen the Orchard Owner lives there, and he hates the apple-stealing
kobolds. Why don't you go visit him and ask him if he still needs help
getting rid of that unruly problem?*

**NOTE:** *This quest is written for players who are levels 3-7, but can
be completed throughout lowmort game.*

<spoiler>Simply wander the town of Wayside and kill 15 kobolds. Return
to Owen once done.</spoiler> The reward for helping
[Owen](Owen_The_Orchard-Owner "wikilink") is the [Wayside Kobold Slayer
Insignia](Wayside_Kobold_Slayer_Insignia "wikilink"), a useful addition
for any character of the right level.
