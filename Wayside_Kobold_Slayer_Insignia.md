One of the first such reward available to a new character, this useful
insignia can be gained through the [Wayside Kobold Slayer
Quest](Wayside_Kobold_Slayer_Quest "wikilink"), and provides low level
players with useful bonuses to make their early adventuring life easier.
The insignia will crumble in approximately 100 levels upon reaching Hero
level 50.

`Wayside Kobold Slayer!`  
`    Modifies spell power by 5% continuous.`  
  
`    or`  
  
`    Modifies melee power by 5 continuous.`

It is up to the player to choose which award variant he desires.

If completed after a certain level, the reward received will be reduced,
for example completing this after level 40 will net only a 3% boost.
