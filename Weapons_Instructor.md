*Scars on his face, with a gruff voice and appearance, this teacher is
in charge of teaching the young gnomes proper fighting technique, for
those who will continue on to be guards, officers, or even (rarely) a
mercenary. He has never been known to give up on a student.*

''"The thing about crossbows versus bows is that you can't parry a close
attack with a bow -- you'd break the poor thing. Now, the smart gnome
will keep a sword or dagger on hand, for those times when you run out of
arrows and need to defend yourself. That's why we have more weapons than
just bows and crossbows: if there were such a thing as a perfect weapon
for all situations, we'd just use that!"
