*This journal begins an exhaustive narrative of Sario's travels
throughout the Tortured Terrain. Your eyes are drawn to the last entry
in the journal:*  
  
*It's the water, it must be-- I'm poisoned and all my herblore fails me
in this dark place. The river springs from the floodlands far to the
southwest from here, it springs directly from the gravesite. It must be
there, the truth, and although I fear I will never make it back to
Midgaard, this journal must reach the Wayfinder. He will know what to
do, to help this place and to redeem the land. The gravesite has been
desecrated! Why must man change the land? Why cannot we simply leave it
alone?*
