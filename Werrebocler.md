*'The mage's bony hand quickly traced a glyph of power in the air. I
tossed another fireball, but a shimmering screen appeared in front of
her and absorbed the blast with a sad little noise. Each time I would
try to get in another hit, that thing got in my way, keening and
chanting. Finally I had to flee.' -from the diaries of Hypex the Green*

*While an elite caste of magi has taken great effort to obscure the
precise effects of the werrebocler spell, it is common knowledge that
this powerful protective incantation is a boon to whoever commands it.*
