*Werredan is the god of war. Not death, not destruction, but glory and
nobility. Leadership, charisma, and the desire to fight forever are the
traits that Werredan the Mighty possess. He is a relaxed god, if you
excel at battle. He doesn't cater to the weak-minded arts of
[Shizaga](Shizaga.md "wikilink") and [Tul-Sith](Tul-Sith.md "wikilink"),
however.*
