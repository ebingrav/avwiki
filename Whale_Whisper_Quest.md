If you did the [Dragon Whisker Quest](Dragon_Whisker_Quest "wikilink")
you may be familiar with the storyline behind Stormkeep and it's barrier
generator. Getting the [Whale Whisper](Whale_Whisper "wikilink") off
[Onaan](Onaan "wikilink") requires getting him to fight you - and since
he is in a safe room you need to trick him into using a dark energy
cartridge instead of a regular one (as shown in the Dragon Whisker
quest).

This is a solo quest, as relevant rooms are private.

-   Teleport to [Big Fish](Big_Fish_In_Cold_Water "wikilink") and move
    3s, 2e, s, e, s, open w, w, d.
-   Murder [whimpering man](Whimpering_Man "wikilink") an retrieve a
    [small black orb](Small_Black_Orb "wikilink") from his corpse.
-   Teleport to [Big Fish](Big_Fish_In_Cold_Water "wikilink") and move
    6e to [Stormkeep](:Category:Stormkeep "wikilink")
    ([map](Stormkeep_Map "wikilink")), and then into the keep, all the
    way up until you reach [Icewolf](Icewolf_(mob) "wikilink"): 5n, 3w,
    s, 3w, n, e, n, u, e, s, w, u, e, n.
-   Kill Icewolf and loot the key and the fang.
-   Unlock n, move n, give fang statue.
-   Move s, give [small black orb](Small_Black_Orb "wikilink") to
    [Onaan](Onaan "wikilink").
-   Be transported into ANOTHER room (of the same name and description),
    with aggressive Onaan. (If you die to him now, you will need to
    repeat the entire quest to get to your corpse, naked).
-   Once dead, loot the [Whale Whisper](Whale_Whisper "wikilink") from
    his smoldering corpse.

## Comments

Onaan is a stomper, so beware psis. Also, if you decept him successfully
even if he doesn't drop it he will not have the weapon on him to loot
when he is dead.

If you're worried about dying to Onaan, you can get two each of the
black orb, fang and key and leave one set in sanc before you fight. This
should make getting back to your corpse a little easier, although there
are still aggies on the way.
