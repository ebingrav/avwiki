*Streaks of white dominate the dense cloud of hair that surrounds a face
calm with [wisdom](Wisdom.md "wikilink"), its dark eyes looking straight
at you with gentle curiosity. She beckons you to sit down and relax
within the shade and whisper of the looming trees. After a long silence
she speaks of [the forest you are
in](:Category:_Shadow_Forest.md "wikilink"), of its magnificence, of how
it once was stretching so much further than this tiny speck. '...no, no.
I was not living at the time. But the old [ent](Ents.md "wikilink"),
that used to spend its time in this precise spot, he was young in those
days. Mind, he is young for an [ent](Ent.md "wikilink") now still - if
he still lives and grows those fragrant leaves of his... All that time I
heard him tell his stories he was in the slow process of deciding on
what to do about those wicked creatures from beyond that ring of
boulders to the east. No, not those stone tricksters or strange beasts.
Something much, much more evil. At last he went and wrought a barrier of
plants to hold the monsters in, and us frail ones out. Yet alas, he went
inside there, looking for some way to remedy the chaos. How I wish I
could hear that slow, deep voice again, to enjoy the slow gentle
thoughts... but the life of us [humans](Humans.md "wikilink") are
short.' No bitterness fills her voice as she says those words, on the
contrary, there is a hint of girlish laughter and mirth.*
