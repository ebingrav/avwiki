## Comments

This knight is stronger than the other three knights on the road, mainly
because it has a weapon.

The plate armor does not have any modifiers on it, but it is fairly
heavy. Some [psionicists](:Category:Psionicists.md "wikilink") like to
use it with the [Dart](Dart_(spell).md "wikilink") spell.

The lance actually has a negative modifier on it (worses your [armor
class](Armor_Class.md "wikilink") by 3), but it is a [hafted
weapon](:Category:Hafted_Weapons.md "wikilink"), so feel free to try it
out.
