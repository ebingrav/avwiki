*Looking like a tribal shaman, the man is dressed in a mishmash of
outmoded military attire and cold-weather furs. His face is lit in a
crisp purple glow eminating from several ether-filled jars hanging from
a belt around his waist, and a flowing cape of long gray and white
feathers wraps around his body. He eyes you with a wary blend of
suspicion and curiosity, before speaking.*

*"Be careful if you proceed further. The fire that walks along the mesa
top will happily grind you to dust, given the chance.*

*"I was drawn here in search of souls of a particular nature. I am a...
collector of such things. They have uses to me that, while I would
rather not detail them, are significant enough to warrant a reward,
should you bring me one.*

*"Other artifacts, while not valuable to me, might at least prove to be
interesting, if you gave me a look."*
