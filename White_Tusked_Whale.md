*This relatively small whale is roughly the size of a human in full
plate armor, but it brandishes two fluted ivory tusks that are nearly
longer than the rest of its body. Whether their purpose is for hunting,
mating, or just decoration, the whale's tusks are no doubt a formidable
defense against hunters, animal and human alike.*
