Syntax: wimpy  
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value. When your character takes damage that
reduces your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically
attempt to flee in a random direction.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit
points. You can see your current wimpy value in the SCORE command.

Some monsters are wimpy, and will flee before dying.
