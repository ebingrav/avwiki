*Withdraw represents the ability of a seasoned
[Rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") to [flee](Flee.md "wikilink")
from combat in a controlled and calculated fashion. By simply providing
a direction when he uses the [flee](Flee.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink"), a
[Rogue](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") who has mastered Withdraw will
[flee](Flee.md "wikilink") in the specified direction, instead of
running out randomly. [Rogues](:Category:_Rogues.md "wikilink") who wish
to use this [skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") must be actively
using the [Alertness](Alertness.md "wikilink")
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") to do so, in order to scout out
all possible escape routes. NOTE: You must type out the full word
"north" "south" "east" "west" "up" "down". Partial typing, typos or any
other mistake will be considered a random [flee](Flee.md "wikilink")
attempt.*

Prerequisite(s): [Alertness](Alertness.md "wikilink"),
[Misdirection](Misdirection.md "wikilink").

Syntax: [flee](Flee.md "wikilink") <direction>.
