*Whether etched in stone or carved on tree bark,
[archer](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink")
[markings](Markings.md "wikilink") are messages generally overlooked by
others. They can be as subtle as a bent branch or a misplaced stone, yet
they speak volumes to one who knows how to read them. Using this
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink"), an
[archer](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink") can
[mark](Mark.md "wikilink") a [room](:Category:_Rooms.md "wikilink"),
leaving a message for his fellow hunters. More importantly, any
[archer](:Category:_Archers.md "wikilink") can find their way to the
[mark](Markings.md "wikilink") using the [seek](Seek.md "wikilink")
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") and the mark's creator's
name. If you have made more than one [mark](Markings.md "wikilink") in
an [area](:Category:_Areas.md "wikilink"), those who attempt to
[seek](Seek.md "wikilink") them will only [seek](Seek.md "wikilink") the
most recently created one. [Marks](Markings.md "wikilink") are to be
considered public [channels](:Category:_Channels.md "wikilink"), and the
usual rules and standards apply.*

Prerequisite(s): [Map Lore](Map_Lore.md "wikilink").
