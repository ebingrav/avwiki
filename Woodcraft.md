*Whether etched in stone or carved on tree bark,
[archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") [markings](Markings "wikilink")
are messages generally overlooked by others. They can be as subtle as a
bent branch or a misplaced stone, yet they speak volumes to one who
knows how to read them. Using this
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink"), an
[archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink") can [mark](Mark "wikilink") a
[room](:Category:_Rooms "wikilink"), leaving a message for his fellow
hunters. More importantly, any [archer](:Category:_Archers "wikilink")
can find their way to the [mark](Markings "wikilink") using the
[seek](Seek "wikilink") [command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") and
the mark's creator's name. If you have made more than one
[mark](Markings "wikilink") in an [area](:Category:_Areas "wikilink"),
those who attempt to [seek](Seek "wikilink") them will only
[seek](Seek "wikilink") the most recently created one.
[Marks](Markings "wikilink") are to be considered public
[channels](:Category:_Channels "wikilink"), and the usual rules and
standards apply.*

Prerequisite(s): [Map Lore](Map_Lore "wikilink").
