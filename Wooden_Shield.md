## Comments

Though this armor has no extra modifiers, it is a low level shield that
can be easily obtained. Since the [base armor on shields are multipled
by 3](Armor_Class.md "wikilink"), it is still useful at low levels. One
also must have a shield to use the [shield
block](Shield_Block.md "wikilink") skill.
