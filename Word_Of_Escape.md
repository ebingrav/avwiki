Syntax: cast 'word of escape'  
Prerequisites: none

This spells harnesses the innate eldritch forces of a Legend's Home
Gateway to pull the Legend to his or her home base. The spell is not
without cost, however. It requires massive amounts of magical energy
both from the caster and the Gateway, as well as a significant delay to
create the connection.
