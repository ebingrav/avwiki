## Comments

There's definitely something funny about this mob. He doesn't always
seem to be in the same place. Here's some hints from Devastant:

<font color=purple> (Devastant) noticed anything odd about yorimandil
yet?  
(Devastant) well, in order to give him a ticket...  
(Devastant) you'd have to first convince him to remove his unremovable,
untakable 999 weight item  
(Devastant) and then unblind him  
(Devastant) that wasnt really meant as a suggestion  
(Devastant) he's no good to you alive  
</font>

This last comment adds to my suspicion that there's something special
about his weapon. See [Old Double-Curved
Sword](Old_Double-Curved_Sword "wikilink") for more information.

Update: we've spotted Yorimandil wandering the [Obsidian Arena
Floor](:Category:Obsidian_Arena;_Floor.md "wikilink"). This version of
Yorimandil was wearing a "Champion's Sash" (or something like that) on
his arms. This item had an inventory flag, so we couldn't loot it after
killing him.

While in his gazebo in iron walkways, his descriptions is: (Demonic)
(Black Aura) A wiry Fae sits here, meditating. A blindfold is tied
around his head.
