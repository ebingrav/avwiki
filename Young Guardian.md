*This guard still has some of his energetic bounce in his step. He is a
replacement for the last guard - the only protector that was able to
break free of the enchantment, but not without the loss of his life.
Though the guards wish dearly to escape from the enchantment - this
curse - none of them are willing to take the route that the dishonored
dead took to get there. Though they have existed eons, none of them
believe that they have truly lived.*
