In room:

    A lost githzerai stays here as Rietta's guest.

Description:

    This githzerai is stranded here until he can figure out a way to                                                       
    get back to Outland and safely inside the Githzerai keep without                                                       
    the Githyanki spotting him.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                           
    He seems to be carrying a lot of Mindflayer scalps. Perhaps if he                                                      
    gets enough of them he can use them to get home.
