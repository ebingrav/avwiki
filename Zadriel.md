*She gazes back at you with blood red eyes, judging you for your sins
and weighing your crimes. Perhaps she will dispense justice, or perhaps
she will use her power at her whim. Fear her. For even when just, she is
cruel and has no mercy.*

*As you gaze upon her, her form becomes transparent and reveals the
constellation which makes up her form; two red stars sitting above seven
others in the rough shape of an hourglass.*

## Directions

From the Astrological Academy: quaff, \[u\], \[u\], \[u\], \[u\].

Each of the doors to get up to her are locked and there is no key to
them. However each of them can be opened with a bit of wisdom learned
from mobs representing each of the seasons. Upon their death they will
impart some wisdom. Use the wisdom to "pull" open the door.
