*ZAP zaps a magical [wand](:Category:_Wands.md "wikilink") at a target.
If the target is not specified, and you are fighting someone, then that
character is used for a target. You must [HOLD](Hold.md "wikilink") a
[wand](:Category:_Wands.md "wikilink") or a
[staff](:Category:_Staves.md "wikilink") before using ZAP. This
[command](:Category:_Commands.md "wikilink") uses up their magical
object. [Wands](:Category:_Wands.md "wikilink") and
[staves](:Category:_Staves.md "wikilink") have multiple charges. When a
[magical object](:Category:_Spellcasting_Gear.md "wikilink") has no more
charges, it will be consumed. One must be adept with the "[arcane
knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge.md "wikilink")"
[skill](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink") to be able to zap items.*

Syntax: zap
\<[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink")/[mob](:Category:_Mobs.md "wikilink")\>.
