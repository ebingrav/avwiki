*ZAP zaps a magical [wand](:Category:_Wands "wikilink") at a target. If
the target is not specified, and you are fighting someone, then that
character is used for a target. You must [HOLD](Hold "wikilink") a
[wand](:Category:_Wands "wikilink") or a
[staff](:Category:_Staves "wikilink") before using ZAP. This
[command](:Category:_Commands "wikilink") uses up their magical object.
[Wands](:Category:_Wands "wikilink") and
[staves](:Category:_Staves "wikilink") have multiple charges. When a
[magical object](:Category:_Spellcasting_Gear "wikilink") has no more
charges, it will be consumed. One must be adept with the "[arcane
knowledge](Arcane_Knowledge "wikilink")"
[skill](:Category:_Skills "wikilink") to be able to zap items.*

Syntax: zap
\<[character](:Category:_Characters "wikilink")/[mob](:Category:_Mobs "wikilink")\>.
