*Zin notices you and says, "Greetings! Welcome to my home in the sky. I
have made several trials for you to undertake if you are willing. They
are dangerous but should you proceed, you may gain wealth and glory
unimagined. Or you may not and I'm just a twisted old
[wizard](:Category:_Wizards "wikilink") who likes to torment people.
Either way, [rest](Rest "wikilink") here for now. I can and will
[heal](Heal_(command) "wikilink") you for a price or I'll help you
[train](Train "wikilink") if you desire." With that, the old man goes
back to looking somewhere unseen. Occasionally he smirks but you cannot
imagine what could be funny that he's looking at.*
