This [flag](:Category:_Character_Flags.md "wikilink") appears only
during [zombiefests](Zombiefests.md "wikilink") and indicates that a
[character](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") is a zombie.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") gain it either when an
[immortal](:Category:_Immortals.md "wikilink") grants it to them or when
they are killed by zombies.

[Characters](:Category:_Characters.md "wikilink") lose it either when
they are killed by non-zombies or when a
[zombiefest](Zombiefests.md "wikilink") ends.
