*Zombie fests are free-for-all quests in which all players online become
combatants in a battle for control of the mud. During a zombie fest,
limited player-killing exists between two groups - undead and living.
Living players killed by zombies become undead and vice versa. Zombie
fests generally last an hour and are announced. They are rare, and it is
considered rude (even punishable) to ask for one. Here are some tips for
zombie fest participants:*

-   *Losses during zombie fests are not reimbursable.
    [Insured](Insure.md "wikilink")
    [items](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink") lost in a crash are the
    only exception.*
-   *If you do not wish to participate, stay in a [safe
    room](Safe_Rooms.md "wikilink") or [log off](Quit.md "wikilink").
    All other actions will put your character at risk.*
-   *Zombies will have ([ZOMBIE](Zombie_Flag.md "wikilink")) next to
    their names and are easily recognizable. All other players are on
    the opposing team.*
-   *Combat may only occur between opposing groups.*
-   *There are limitations on killing players smaller than you.*
-   *Successful [bounty](Bounty_Flag.md "wikilink") kills result in a
    generous [experience](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") gain.*
-   *There is no [gear](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") loss when you
    die; [equipment](:Category:_Gear.md "wikilink") stays on your body.*
-   ''[Effects](Affects.md "wikilink") of
    [skills](:Category:_Skills.md "wikilink"),
    [spells](:Category:_Spells.md "wikilink"),
    [racials](:Category:_Racials.md "wikilink"), or anything else are
    not cleared upon [death](Death.md "wikilink").
-   [Death](Death.md "wikilink") is inevitable. Embrace it and move
    on.''
-   *[Hit points](Hit_Points.md "wikilink"),
    [mana](Mana_Points.md "wikilink"), and [movement
    points](Move_Points.md "wikilink") will be scarce. Stock up on
    useful [items](:Category:_Objects.md "wikilink").*
-   *Have fun.*
