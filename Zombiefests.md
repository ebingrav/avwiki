*Zombie fests are free-for-all quests in which all players online become
combatants in a battle for control of the mud. During a zombie fest,
limited player-killing exists between two groups - undead and living.
Living players killed by zombies become undead and vice versa. Zombie
fests generally last an hour and are announced. They are rare, and it is
considered rude (even punishable) to ask for one. Here are some tips for
zombie fest participants:*

-   *Losses during zombie fests are not reimbursable.
    [Insured](Insure "wikilink") [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink")
    lost in a crash are the only exception.*
-   *If you do not wish to participate, stay in a [safe
    room](Safe_Rooms "wikilink") or [log off](Quit "wikilink"). All
    other actions will put your character at risk.*
-   *Zombies will have ([ZOMBIE](Zombie_Flag "wikilink")) next to their
    names and are easily recognizable. All other players are on the
    opposing team.*
-   *Combat may only occur between opposing groups.*
-   *There are limitations on killing players smaller than you.*
-   *Successful [bounty](Bounty_Flag "wikilink") kills result in a
    generous [experience](Experience_Points "wikilink") gain.*
-   *There is no [gear](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") loss when you die;
    [equipment](:Category:_Gear "wikilink") stays on your body.*
-   ''[Effects](Affects "wikilink") of
    [skills](:Category:_Skills "wikilink"),
    [spells](:Category:_Spells "wikilink"),
    [racials](:Category:_Racials "wikilink"), or anything else are not
    cleared upon [death](Death "wikilink").
-   [Death](Death "wikilink") is inevitable. Embrace it and move on.''
-   *[Hit points](Hit_Points "wikilink"),
    [mana](Mana_Points "wikilink"), and [movement
    points](Move_Points "wikilink") will be scarce. Stock up on useful
    [items](:Category:_Objects "wikilink").*
-   *Have fun.*
