## Comments

The main flaw of the armor is that it offers 5 AC less protection than
comparative Midgaardian equivalents.

However, it more than makes up in added hp bonus, as well as extremely
low weight for an AC body piece - making it almost 4 times lighter than
[Carburized Steel Plate Armor](Carburized_Steel_Plate_Armor "wikilink").
This makes it a very good alternative for the low-strength and low-hp
races (especially casters), such as [sprites](Sprite.md "wikilink") and
similar.

It is difficult to enchant, but a double-brilled Cowl will be slightly
better than a non-enchanted Carburized plate, and is much, much easier
to obtain.
